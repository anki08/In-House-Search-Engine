https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCE3RPkMV8M,0,What is a novel coronavirus?,"0:06
So, the coronavirus are amongst us all the time. We have the so-called calm
0:13
coronavirus which results in respiratory infections with runny nose, and cough and
0:19
sore throat, mostly during winter time. There are some coronavirus strains like
0:26
the new novel coronavirus which has a more severe presentation of symptoms
0:33
similar to what we had in the past with SARS and more recently MERS-CoV virus.
0:39
This being said, it seems based on current data that the new or the novel
0:45
coronavirus is somewhere in the middle in terms of severity between our common
0:51
coronaviruses and SARS and MERS. So, from an HHS perspective, the main emphasis at
0:58
this point is on screening. We want to make sure that no patient gets into our
1:03
system without us knowing that the patient was potentially exposed to a
1:08
patient with the novel coronavirus or a patient with a relevant travel history.
1:13
This being said, this definition, of what we call the case definition, may change
1:20
any time and what I'm telling you right now may be different later today.
1:25
For most people it will not make a major difference when they get in to a
1:29
hospital, it being at Hamilton health sciences or any of the other hospitals.
1:33
The screening consists of questions you are being asked when you get registered
1:39
or when you're going through triage, and they will
1:45
ask you whether you have a relevant travel history and whether you have any
1:49
respiratory symptoms. This being said, this is not a new concept. We used to ask
1:58
those questions previously as well. But, now we do react if you would be telling
2:03
us, ""Oh I was in Wuhan and I have a cough at this point of time."" If that's
2:09
the case you would be isolated in a private room, people seeing you would be
2:16
wearing gowns and masks and gloves just to make sure that if you have that virus
2:20
that it wouldn't transmit. And then you would need to get tested and we would
2:26
have to wait for that result. But, as you see, that only applies to those patients
2:32
who had a exposure or potential exposure to the virus. For everyone else it's
2:37
status quo, nothing would change other than the fact that you would need to
2:42
respond to those questions upon admission.

A new type of coronavirus has emerged from the city of Wuhan in China.
0:06
Within weeks it has spread to several countries and has killed multiple people.
0:15
Corona refers to the virus’s distinctive shape.
0:20
They are a large group, common among mammals and birds.
0:27
But in rare cases like this one, they can spread to humans - a process known as zoonosis.
0:37
This new virus is the seventh known human coronavirus
0:41
and it affects the respiratory system.
0:44
Some coronaviruses have mild symptoms,
0:47
however others are much more dangerous.
0:51
SARS and MERS are both coronaviruses.
0:58
The most urgent question is how does it spread?
1:01
It seems that the virus can be transmitted between humans,
1:04
but it’s still unclear whether this happens routinely.
1:09
Some early severe cases caused a lot of concern,
1:13
but this has receded slightly, as more mild cases turn up.
1:17
The new virus does not seem to be as deadly as SARS,
1:20
which killed around 11% of the people it infected.
1:27
Researchers think that the virus originated
1:30
in an unknown animal at a market in Wuhan.
1:33
Identifying that animal could help control the current outbreak
1:37
and gauge its threat going forward.
1:41
The virus’s genetic code could offer clues to its origins and spread.
1:46
Labs in China and Thailand have sequenced at least 19 strains from infected people,
1:50
and made them publicly available.
1:53
Analysis is ongoing.
1:57
There are no known drugs that can effectively treat coronavirus infections in humans,
2:02
and no vaccines are currently licensed.
2:05
But researchers are working on the problem.
2:08
One possible avenue is to block the receptor
2:11
the viruses use to infect humans.
2:14
With more cases being reported every day,
2:16
the race is on to contain the outbreak.
2:19
And scientists are at the heart of the effort.

the kovit 19 virus
0:04
spreads mainly between people in close
0:06
contact with each other
0:08
it spreads most easily in crowded
0:10
settings
0:14
closed spaces with poor ventilation or
0:17
through prolonged contact with an
0:19
infected person
0:21
this is because as a person infected
0:23
with the covet-19 virus
0:25
breathes talks coughs
0:28
or sneezes liquid particles of various
0:31
sizes
0:32
are expelled into the air larger
0:35
particles are called droplets
0:38
smaller particles are called aerosols
0:41
you can contract the virus if infected
0:43
particles come into contact with your
0:45
eyes
0:46
nose or mouth whether you are inside or
0:50
outside
0:51
always maintain a physical distance of
0:53
at least one meter from others
0:56
when you are in an enclosed or poorly
0:58
ventilated space
1:00
the virus can spread more easily
1:03
in these conditions aerosols can remain
1:06
suspended in the air
1:08
or travel farther than one meter when
1:12
you are inside
1:13
make sure to stay at least one meter
1:14
from others
1:16
wear a mask open a window to improve
1:19
ventilation
1:21
and limit your time spent in these
1:23
settings
1:24
to protect yourself and others always
1:27
follow
1:28
these six precautions
",,,,,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSu1who-Bk8,5,How does the virus spread?,"0:05
germs are everywhere
0:07
they live on surfaces like tables door
0:09
handles
0:10
light switches on your mobile phone on
0:13
jewelry
0:14
on your skin and even inside your body
0:18
many of them aren't harmful to us in
0:20
fact there are numerous types that work
0:22
in harmony with our body to keep us
0:24
healthy
0:25
of course some germs are harmful and can
0:28
make us ill
0:29
if they gain entry into the body such as
0:31
through a cut in the skin
0:33
breathed in through the lungs or if you
0:35
eat something without washing your hands
0:37
they can cause an infection germs can
0:40
spread very easily
0:42
and our hands are particularly good at
0:44
picking them up and spreading them
0:46
from and to things that we touch which
0:48
increases the risk of them spreading to
0:50
people
0:52
despite this many germs including
0:54
coronaviruses
0:56
are easily inactivated or removed by
0:58
simply washing your hands with soap and
1:00
water
1:01
or by applying an alcohol hand rub
1:05
disposable gloves can protect your hands
1:07
from dirt
1:08
and should be worn if you think you may
1:10
come into contact with bodily fluids or
1:12
feces
1:14
but if you touch an infected surface the
1:16
gloves themselves can become
1:18
contaminated
1:19
which means they can still spread germs
1:21
in exactly the same way that ungloved
1:23
hands do
1:25
for example let's say you touch an
1:27
infected tissue with gloves on
1:30
you carry on with your usual day and
1:32
without thinking about it you rub your
1:34
eye
1:34
then later on you hand a glass of water
1:37
to someone you're caring for
1:40
the germs from the tissue have
1:41
effectively been passed on to anything
1:44
you touch
1:45
which means that you and this gentleman
1:47
could become ill
1:49
this is why gloves must be put on
1:51
immediately before one task
1:54
taken off immediately after it's done
1:56
and thrown away
1:58
you still need to wash your hands after
2:00
removing the gloves too
2:01
as germs can pass from the gloves onto
2:04
your hands
2:04
as you take them off like many other
2:08
germs the coronavirus is mostly spread
2:10
by droplets
2:11
which are breathed out from the lungs
2:13
and can directly enter another person's
2:15
mouth
2:15
nose or eyes allowing it to enter the
2:18
body
2:20
as we've seen if the infected droplets
2:22
find their way onto surfaces
2:24
such as if an infected person blows
2:27
their nose
2:28
then touches a door handle the virus can
2:30
then survive
2:31
there meaning someone else could become
2:34
infected
2:34
if they touch it too this is why
2:38
it's so important to follow appropriate
2:41
procedures for cleaning surfaces
2:43
to wash your hands properly and often
2:45
particularly before and after contact
2:48
with people you're caring for
2:50
to follow current advice on ppe such as
2:53
when to wear eye protection disposable
2:55
aprons or gloves
2:57
and to wear a surgical mask appropriate
3:00
for the situation you're working in
3:02
these measures can prevent the
3:04
coronavirus and many other harmful germs
3:07
from spreading

What is CORONAVIRUS AND How to PROTECT YOURSELF
0:03
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC.
0:07
The expert body on coronavirus
0:09
has released guidance for general public
0:11
and healthcare professionals
0:13
on the symptoms of the virus.
0:15
A person could be at risk
0:17
if they have any or all of the following.
0:19
Fever and symptoms of lower respiratory illness.
0:22
Such as coughing or difficulty breathing
0:24
after traveling to Wuhan
0:26
or having close contact with someone who is ill
0:29
and is now under investigation for the virus in the past two weeks.
0:32
Fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness
0:35
after having close contact in the past two weeks
0:38
with someone who's been confirmed to have the virus.
0:41
The CDC defined close contact
0:44
as being within about 6 feet (1.8 meters)
0:48
or within the room or care area
0:50
of a person with the coronavirus
0:52
for a prolonged period without appropriate protective clothing
0:56
or having direct contact with the infectious secretions
0:59
of a person with the virus without protective clothing.
1:02
Coronaviruses are particularly dangerous
1:05
for people who have weaker immune systems,
1:08
like young children and older adults.
1:11
To protect yourself from the virus.
1:13
Try to avoid contact with people who display symptoms
1:16
similar to those of pneumonia
1:18
or the common cold by coughing
1:20
or a runny nose.
1:21
Don't touch your eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
1:25
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water
1:28
and scrub for at least 20 seconds.
1:30
Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when possible.
1:34
Avoid animals and animal markets.
1:36
The only current treatment for coronavirus
1:39
being offered is supportive in nature.
1:41
If you notice any of these symptoms and conditions.
1:44
Please contact your nearest professional healthcare setup.
1:48
Help spread this information to everyone.

lots of people are worrying about
0:04
coronavirus and we see a lot of people
0:06
with masks can I only get sick and I
0:07
think do I really need to go out most
0:09
people if you catch coronavirus it'll be
0:12
mild but for some coronavirus could be
0:14
really serious these are mostly older
0:16
people and people with underlying health
0:18
conditions things like asthma diabetes
0:21
and heart disease good news is you can
0:23
protect yourself and the NHS says you
0:26
should do these things even if you're
0:28
not likely to be seriously affected by
0:30
coronavirus you may pass it on to
0:32
someone who could be number one wash
0:35
your hands more the more you wash your
0:37
hands the less likely you are to spread
0:39
the virus to other people so if you've
0:40
been out in a public place on a bus or a
0:42
train wash your hands as soon as you can
0:45
afterwards and properly wash your hands
0:46
so that takes about 20 seconds to get
0:49
them really clean focusing on all parts
0:51
of your hand not just your palm backs of
0:54
hands around the nails in between the
0:56
fingers wrists and your thumb and use
0:59
soap and water and when you're done turn
1:01
the tap off using a tissue and put it in
1:03
the bin antibacterial gels do work but
1:07
soap and water is best number two avoid
1:10
touching your eyes nose and mouth
1:12
because that's the way the virus could
1:14
get into your body you can still touch
1:16
your face but only if you've washed your
1:18
hands before number three catching your
1:21
coughs and sneezes experts think corona
1:23
virus is spread by droplets that come
1:25
out of your nose and mouth so when you
1:27
sneeze or cough catch them with
1:29
disposable tissues then binet and wash
1:32
your hands
1:33
disposable tissues are better than
1:35
handkerchief so that you carry around
1:36
with you all the time if you don't have
1:38
a tissue sneeze or cough into the crook
1:40
of your elbow that way the germs are
1:44
away from your hands and you're less
1:46
likely to pass them on unless you greet
1:48
people using your elbow don't touch
1:50
things with your hands if you don't have
1:51
to the less you touch things like
1:53
surfaces handrails lift buttons and less
1:57
likely you are to catch the virus or
1:59
indeed spread it on number 4 stay away
2:02
from people who are ill if people are
2:05
unwell don't get too close to them the
2:07
closer you get the more likely you are
2:09
to catch something apart
2:10
that you should go about your life as
2:12
normal that means you should go to work
2:14
go to school and see your friends unless
2:17
you've been told not to by your doctor
2:18
or the NHS one-one-one coronavirus
2:21
service when it comes to traveling check
2:23
with the Foreign Office before you plan
2:25
to go now it's important to say that
2:27
there's no evidence that you can catch
2:29
corona virus from letters parcels or
2:32
food and these things won't work when it
2:36
comes to treating corona virus UV light
2:38
antibiotics garlic and saline solution
2:42
as for masks they're important when
2:45
people are in very close contact with
2:46
patients but there's very little
2:48
evidence that masks are helpful in
2:50
everyday life if you've been coughing or
2:53
you have a high temperature or you're
2:54
short of breath you may have the
2:56
symptoms of corona virus but you don't
2:58
necessarily have corona virus but if you
3:01
think you may do don't go anywhere
3:04
especially not the hospital pharmacy or
3:07
doctors instead phone your doctor or use
3:12
the online NHS one-one-one coronavirus
3:15
service and there'll be the ones who can
3:17
tell you what you should do next

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPpoJGYlW54,31,What about imported animals or animal products?,"0:00
It was New Years Eve, 2019 when health officials in China admitted they had a problem.
0:04
Health authorities have activated their most serious response level.
0:08
After an outbreak of a new type of viral pneumonia
0:11
in central China.
0:13
A rapidly growing number of people were developing a dry cough and fever, before getting pneumonia.
0:20
And for some, it turned fatal.
0:23
Doctors have named the disease COVID-19 or “coronavirus disease, 2019” indicating
0:28
that a type of virus is causing the illness.
0:32
When they’d tried to trace its origin, they found a likely source:
0:36
This food market in Wuhan.
0:38
Out of the first 41 patients, 27 had been here.
0:42
It wasn’t conclusive evidence, but Chinese officials quickly shut down the market.
0:46
They had seen this happen before at a place just like this.
0:50
Health officials are trying to get a grip on an alarming outbreak of SARS.
0:55
The virus originated in mainland China.
0:57
Then spread across the country.
0:58
The disease had been festering for months in southern China.
1:02
In 2002, a coronavirus had emerged at a very similar market, in southern China.
1:06
It eventually reached 29 countries and killed nearly 800 people.
1:11
Now, 18 years later, this coronavirus is in at least 71 countries and has already killed
1:16
over 3100 people.
1:19
So, what do these markets have to do with the coronavirus outbreak… and why is it
1:23
happening in China?
1:33
A lot of the viruses that make us sick, actually originate in animals.
1:38
Some of the viruses that cause the flu come from birds and pigs.
1:42
HIV/AIDS comes from chimpanzees.
1:43
The deadly Ebola virus likely originates in bats.
1:46
And in the case of the 2019 coronavirus, there is some evidence it went from a bat to a pangolin
1:53
before infecting a human.
1:54
While viruses are very good at jumping between species, it’s rare for a deadly one to make
1:59
this journey all the way to humans.
2:01
That’s because it would need all these hosts to encounter each other at some point.
2:05
That’s where the Wuhan market comes in.
2:07
It’s a wet-market.
2:10
A kind of place where live animals are slaughtered and sold for consumption.
2:22
Peter Li is a professor and expert on China’s animal trade.
2:41
That’s exactly how a virus can jump from one animal to another.
2:45
If that animal then comes in contact with or is consumed by a human, the virus could
2:49
potentially infect them.
2:51
And if the virus then spreads to other humans, it causes an outbreak.
2:55
Wet-markets are scattered all over the world, but the ones in China are particularly well
2:59
known because they offer a wide variety of animals, including wildlife.
3:03
This is a sample menu, reportedly from the market in Wuhan.
3:07
These animals are from all over the world and each one has the potential to carry its
3:10
own viruses to the market.
3:13
The reason all these animals are in the same market is because of a decision China’s
3:16
government made decades ago.
3:22
Back in the 1970s, China was falling apart.
3:25
Famine had killed more than 36 million people.
3:28
And the communist regime, which controlled all food production, was failing to feed its
3:32
more than 900 million people.
3:36
In 1978, on the verge of collapse, the regime gave up this control and allowed private farming.
3:42
While large companies increasingly dominated the production of popular foods like pork
3:46
and poultry, some smaller farmers turned to catching and raising wild animals as a way
3:50
to sustain themselves.
4:03
And since it started to feed and sustain people, the Chinese government backed it.
4:20
But then in 1988, the government made a decision that changed the shape of wildlife trade in
4:25
China.
4:26
They enacted the Wildlife Protection Law which designated the animals as “resources owned
4:31
by the state” and protected people engaged in the “utilization of wildlife resources”.
4:49
The law also “encouraged the domestication and breeding of wildlife.”
4:53
With that, an industry was born.
4:57
Small local farms turned into industrial-sized operations.
5:03
For example, this bear farm started with just three, and eventually grew to more than 1,000 bears.
5:08
Bigger populations meant greater chances that a sick animal could spread disease.
5:13
Farmers were also raising a wide variety of animals.
5:15
Which meant more viruses on the farms.
5:19
Nonetheless, these animals were funneled into the wet-markets for profit.
5:24
While this legal wildlife farming industry started booming, it simultaneously provided
5:28
cover for an illegal wildlife industry.
5:31
Endangered animals like tigers, rhinoceroses, and pangolins, were trafficked into China.
5:36
By the early 2000s, these markets were teeming with wild animals when the inevitable happened.
5:41
The latest on the deadly SARS virus, the worldwide death toll up again today.
5:45
China has reported more than 1,400 cases of infection nation-wide.
5:51
It is what health officials have feared all along.
5:54
In 2003, the SARS outbreak was traced to a wet-market here, in southern China.
6:00
Scientists found traces of the virus in farmed civet cats.
6:03
Chinese officials quickly shut down the markets and banned wildlife farming.
6:06
But a few months after the outbreak, the Chinese government declared 54 species of wildlife
6:12
animals, including civet cats, legal to farm again.
6:16
By 2004, the wildlife-farming industry was worth an estimated $100 billion yuan.
6:20
And it exerted significant influence over the Chinese government.
6:33
It's because of this influence that the Chinese government has allowed these markets to grow
6:37
over the years.
6:38
In 2016, for example, the government sanctioned the farming of some endangered species like
6:43
tigers, and pangolins.
6:45
By 2018, the wildlife industry had grown to 148 billion yuan and had developed clever
6:51
marketing tactics to keep the markets around.
7:09
Yet, these products became popular with an influential portion of China’s population:
7:25
It’s this minority that the Chinese government chose to favor over the safety of the rest
7:29
of its population.
7:38
Soon after the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government shut down thousands
7:42
of wet-markets and temporarily banned wildlife trade again.
7:46
Organizations around the world have been urging China to make the ban permanent.
7:52
Chinese social media, in particular, has been flooded with petitions to ban it for good this time.
7:57
In response, China is reportedly amending the Wildlife Protection Law that encouraged
8:02
wildlife farming decades ago.
8:04
But unless these actions lead to a permanent ban on wildlife farming, outbreaks like this
8:08
one are bound to happen again.
8:15
For a bunch more information about China’s wet-markets, viruses, and wildlife,
8:20
we have an episode on our Netflix show called The Next Pandemic, explained.
8:24
It talks about a coronavirus could spark the next pandemic and what the world’s experts are doing to stop it.
8:29
That’s on our Netflix show ‘Explained’. Check it out.

kovid 19 and air travel a new study out
0:02
today
0:03
seeking to answer a major question as we
0:05
head into the holiday travel season
0:08
just how risky is it abc's gio benitez
0:12
has the details
0:14
with a mannequin on board we're getting
0:15
a look at how particles may
0:17
move through an airplane the department
0:21
of defense working with united airlines
0:23
conducting 300 tests over
0:25
six months the mannequin reproducing
0:27
breathing and coughing with
0:29
and without a mask when the dummy wore
0:31
mask the results were encouraging
0:33
though they haven't been peer reviewed
0:35
the risk of transmission
0:36
is virtually non-existent virtually
0:39
non-existent and again this is this
0:41
is a this is a us military study here's
0:43
how the tests worked the mannequin was
0:46
equipped with an aerosol generator
0:47
technicians would have it breathe and
0:49
cough with a mask
0:50
on and off using more than 40 sensors
0:53
throughout the plane to detect the
0:55
spread of droplets
0:56
the researchers found that with the mask
0:58
on only 0.003 percent of particles
1:02
actually made their way
1:04
into another passenger's breathing zone
1:06
but the team
1:07
didn't attempt to replicate what might
1:08
happen when the infected person stands
1:11
up or moves through the cabin
1:12
i'm not standing here telling people
1:14
that i know exactly what they should do
1:16
but what i am telling people is if you
1:18
are inclined to travel or thinking about
1:20
air travel
1:21
there is a reason today based on this
1:23
independent study
1:24
that you can feel confident that you can
1:26
travel safely on an aircraft
1:28
the study also reflected similar earlier
1:30
studies that found a plane's unique
1:32
airflow helps minimize risk
1:34
on a plane air flows down from above
1:37
each seat
1:37
not front to back this helps limit
1:40
person-to-person airflow
1:41
a hepa filter eliminating 99.99 percent
1:45
of airborne particles
1:46
including viruses every two to three
1:48
minutes just last week the international
1:51
air transport association released new
1:53
research saying
1:54
the risk of contracting the virus on a
1:56
plane appears to be
1:57
in the same category as being struck by
2:00
lightning
2:01
among 1.2 billion travelers they found
2:03
just
2:04
44 published cases of potential
2:06
in-flight transmission
2:08
mostly in the early days of the pandemic
2:10
when masks weren't required
2:12
this study is confirming that you know
2:14
among all the different
2:16
places where one can get infected
2:19
flights might actually
2:20
be one of the safest places to be but
2:23
remember flying involves more than a
2:25
plane
2:25
as more people start traveling for the
2:27
holidays airports will also get busier
2:30
so experts remind us it's critical to
2:32
wear that mask as you walk into the
2:34
airport
2:35
go through security board that airplane
2:37
sit through the flight
2:38
and land at your destination
2:42
now there are some caveats they only use
2:44
one type of mask a surgical one
2:46
and they simulated just one sick
2:48
passenger on a completely full
2:49
plane but clearly this was an extensive
2:52
study and it gives us
2:53
a real clue gio benitez abc news new

travel in general is an issue amidst
0:01
covet 19 but many are especially loath
0:04
to consider air travel
0:05
the idea of settling yourself into a

sealed tube with a bunch of other people

for up to several hours

in the middle of a global pandemic just

doesn't sit right

0:40
healthcaretriage so are we concerned
0:41
about air travel maybe
0:43
but maybe not for the reasons you might
0:45
think a few studies have come out
0:47
recently suggesting that
0:48
in-flight transmission rates are low and
0:50
places like
0:51
airlines for america have been
0:53
vigorously promoting them since these
0:55
studies have a few issues like
0:57
using mannequins which don't chat with
0:59
neighbors or move about the cabin
1:01
or having been funded by airlines we
1:04
decided to take a wider look at the
1:06
literature
1:06
to the research according to a 2005
1:09
review in the lancet
1:10
disease transmission is associated with
1:12
flights exceeding eight hours in
1:14
duration
1:14
and with sitting within two rows of an
1:17
infected individual
1:18
a recently published review of all
1:20
flights with potential sars cov2
1:22
transmission
1:23
from january 24th to september 21st of
1:26
this year
1:26
summarize the risk of in-flight
1:28
transmission as low
1:30
an october article on the jama patient
1:32
page points out that risk is often low
1:34
on flights due to the way the cabin air
1:36
is maintained
1:38
the air volume in a plane's cabin is
1:40
refreshed regularly
1:41
with air entering from overhead and
1:43
flowing downward to exited floor outlets
1:46
from there around half is vented outside
1:49
while the rest is sent through high
1:50
efficiency particulate air filters
1:53
like those used in hospitals once
1:55
filtered the air is mixed with fresh air
1:57
brought in from
1:58
outside and then pushed back into the
2:00
cabin so the air is pretty clean
2:01
compared to most settings
2:03
but that's not to say that we haven't
2:04
seen some data suggesting risk
2:06
a 2003 study examined three separate
2:09
flights known to have carried someone
2:11
infected with
2:12
sars another coronavirus on one
2:14
three-hour flight
2:15
they found 22 probable transmissions
2:17
with 34
2:18
of those who sat in the same row or
2:21
within three rows of the infected
2:23
individual reporting illness
2:24
although 56 percent of the individuals
2:26
who became infected
2:28
were not seated within that proximity
2:30
however their examination of the other
2:32
two flights found possible infection of
2:34
only one person on a 90-minute flight
2:36
carrying four symptomatic individuals
2:38
and no infection detected on a 90-minute
2:41
flight carrying one pre-symptomatic
2:43
individual
2:44
study published in 2018 examined the
2:46
behavior and movements of both
2:47
passengers
2:48
and crew during 10 flights these flights
2:51
ranged from 211 to 313 minutes
2:54
and eight of them took place during flu
2:56
season researchers then
2:58
simulated infection risk based on the
3:00
behavioral and movement data
3:01
reporting the transmission from a sick
3:03
passenger would be greater to those in
3:05
nearby rows
3:06
but would only result in an additional
3:08
0.7
3:09
average infected people per flight in
3:12
contrast
3:13
a sick crew member would infect an
3:15
estimated 4.6 passengers
3:18
the researchers also gathered air and
3:20
hard surface samples to test for 18
3:22
common respiratory viruses
3:24
all of which came back negative another
3:25
study out this month found that the
3:26
current coronavirus was transmitted to
3:28
16 of 217 passengers and crew
3:31
on a 10-hour flight 12 of those were in
3:33
business class with the only symptomatic
3:36
person on the flight
3:37
while the other 25 were seated elsewhere
3:39
so the results are mixed
3:41
some of these studies considered the
3:42
behavior of those on board and some did
3:44
not
3:44
some considered mask usage and some did
3:47
not some studied flights with known
3:49
infections on board while others
3:50
employed simulations
3:52
and of course none of them can
3:53
definitively prove the occurrence of
3:55
in-flight transmission the cdc does
3:57
mention that air circulation in plane
3:59
cabins prevents easy spread of viruses
4:01
and other germs but notes that socially
4:04
distancing is difficult on crowded
4:05
flights
4:06
and thus the risk of contracting covid19
4:08
may be increased
4:09
that risk might be reduced by the use of
4:11
face masks which are currently mandatory
4:12
when flying
4:13
and by measures like leaving the middle
4:15
seat open which one pre-print suggests
4:17
might make a difference
4:18
however no one seems to be talking about
4:20
the risk outside of the airplane
4:22
though phase two of a study funded by
4:23
airlines for america does plan to
4:25
examine
4:26
curbed curb journeys that include the
4:28
entire experience of traveling
4:30
a lot of people use public
4:31
transportation to get to the airport
4:33
after that they have to stand in a
4:34
security line with all the other
4:36
passengers
4:37
from there they make their way along
4:38
with everyone else to the gate and the
4:40
eventual boarding process
4:42
the shared areas are numerous and the
4:44
many commonly touched surfaces in all of
4:46
those areas
4:47
represent a risk as well here's my
4:49
biggest concern i'm just not confident
4:51
that the person sitting behind me didn't
4:53
wake up feeling sick
4:54
and then decide they weren't going to
4:55
miss their flight i don't want to be
4:57
anyone's close contact
4:59
and this is a risk i'll avoid if i can
5:01
that's not to say those risks can't be
5:02
managed
5:03
hand washing temperature checking mass
5:05
and social distancing
5:06
are just some of the precautions that we
5:08
can take but it's like we said in
5:10
last week's episode your choices add to
5:12
your safety pile or your wrist pile
5:14
when you take into account everything
5:16
involved air travel most certainly adds
5:18
to the risk pile hey do you enjoy this
