0,Can SARS-CoV-2 infect pets?,"As of April 19, the only pets incidentally exposed to COVID-19 that have tested positive, with confirmation, for SARS-CoV-2 are two pet dogs and a pet cat in Hong Kong. Another pet cat in Belgium tested positive, but details around that case are less clear.. In each case, the pet was in the care of and had close contact with a person who had been confirmed to have COVID-19. Only in the case of the cat in Belgium was there a suggestion of the animal showing clinical signs of disease and, in that case, other diseases and conditions that could have caused those same signs of illness were not ruled out and there are also questions about how samples demonstrating the presence of SARS-CoV-2 were collected and evaluated. That cat recovered.In a French study, tests (RT-PCR and antibody evaluation via an immunoprecipitation assay) performed on 21 pets (12 dogs and 9 cats) living in close contact with their 20 French veterinary student owners (2 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and 11 more of whom showed symptoms consistent with COVID-19) all yielded negative results.Two commercial laboratories in the United States reported they have tested (RT-PCR) thousands of specimens from dogs and cats for SARS-CoV-2 and have obtained no positive results. These specimens have come from the United States, South Korea, Canada, and Europe, including regions concurrently experiencing human COVID-19 cases. While this is encouraging, the specimens tested were originally submitted for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of more common pathogens causing respiratory disease in dogs and cats and, as such, per-case information as to whether or not these dogs and cats had contact with confirmed COVID-19 positive people is not available.As of April 19, the CDC had not received any National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL)-confirmed reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals.There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can cause them to become ill, but these are species-specific, meaning that they do not infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.We will continue to provide you with information as we learn more about pets and SARS-COV-2. Because animals can spread other diseases to people and people can also spread diseases to animals, it’s a good idea to always wash your hands before and after interacting with and caring for your pets, as well as before and after handling their food, supplies, and waste.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
1,How are people with COVID-19 treated?,"Current clinical management includes the application of infection prevention and control measures, such as separating the patient from other people and pets in the home and aggressive hygiene and disinfection and supportive care, including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated. While researchers are studying new drugs and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions as possible treatments for COVID-19 (e.g., Remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, investigational antivirals, immunotherapeutics, host-directed therapies), currently there are no drugs that are specifically FDA-approved for treatment of this disease. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development and approval process for COVID-19 treatments. Information on registered clinical trials for COVID-19 in the United States is available at ClinicalTrials.gov. Interest has emerged regarding ivermectin as a potential treatment after Australian scientists demonstrated that a single dose eradicated all genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 growing in cell culture within 48 hours. Additional testing in animals and people is required to determine whether these in vitro results are mirrored in vivo and what dose might be effective in treating the virus, while still being safe to administer to people. There has been similar interest around the use of chloroquine phosphate after a publication was released suggesting some efficacy for its use in treating COVID-19-associated pneumonia in clinical studies. While used to treat malaria and certain other conditions in people, chloroquine phosphate is also available in a different formulation to treat disease in aquarium fish and at least one person has died from ingesting chloroquine phosphate in that formulation. Because ivermectin is also readily available in formulations used to treat animals, similar concerns exist around the misuse of this drug and FDA has issued a warning accordingly.While we are all anxious to find a treatment for COVID-19, it is very important that people not self-medicate with prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs that are not prescribed or recommended for them by their doctor for their particular health condition(s) and veterinarians should advise clients accordingly.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
2,Can I get COVID-19 from a person not showing any clinical signs?,"Onset and duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known. There are reports of asymptomatic infections (detection of virus with no development of corresponding symptoms) and pre-symptomatic infections (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in transmission is not yet known. Based on existing literature, the incubation period (detection of virus prior to development of symptoms) ranges from two to 14 days.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
3,How are respiratory droplets and contact with them related to SARS-CoV-2 exposure?,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 most often occurs when a person infected with the virus releases droplets by coughing, sneezing, speaking, singing, or exhaling. These droplets are generally too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall onto floors or other surfaces. All else being equal, the stronger the exhale (coughing or sneezing as compared with normal exhalation) the more droplets are released and the farther the droplets may be dispersed. Taking this into account, many states have now adopted social distancing of 6 feet because virtually all sizes of droplets disperse short of that radius.Exhaled droplets eventually land somewhere; for example, on hands, shirt sleeves, countertops, and floors. Droplets can also land on or be transferred by touch to other often-touched surfaces, such as door handles, silver and dinnerware, keys, and steering wheels. Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have been shown to survive in the environment from a few hours to a few days, depending on the type of surface, temperature, humidity, and contact with ultraviolet light. Touching one’s mouth, nose, or eyes with SARS-CoV-2-contaminated hands after touching contaminated surfaces is a secondary route of exposure. Results of an experimental laboratory study suggest that detectable amounts of SARS-CoV-2 virus remain in the air, and on copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic during favorable conditions for the virus (71 to 73°F) for three, four, 24, 72, and 72 hours, respectively. This study, however, involved a much larger viral load than might be expected after normal exposures so the retention times reported may be a worse-case scenario. Virus was also detected in a hospital room of a COVID-19 patient prior to routine cleaning, but no virus was detected after routine cleaning of that patient’s room.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
4,How are humans most commonly exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus?,"SARS-CoV-2 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, including between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet [2 meters]), through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms of the disease, so maintaining social distance (about 6 feet) is important to preventing the spread of COVID-19. It may be possible to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly your eyes. While this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, CDC recommends people practice frequent hand hygiene, which is either washing hands with soap or water or using an alcohol-based hand rub. CDC also recommends routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
5,How did SARS-CoV-2 get from bats to people? Was there an intermediate host?,"The precise mechanism of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bats (if that is where SARS-CoV-2 came from) to people is not presently known. At least two scenarios have been proposed. The first has the virus evolving to its current pathogenicity through natural section in a non-human host (e.g., bat) and jumping to humans. There are no documented cases of bat to human transmission of a coronavirus; previous coronaviruses have passed through an intermediate mammal host before human infection. The identity of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host (if there is one) is also currently unknown, but several have been suggested including pangolins and stray dogs. In an alternative scenario, a nonpathogenic version of the virus would have jumped from an animal host to humans and then evolved within humans to its current pathogenic state. These are all hypotheses based on comparative analysis of RNA coronaviral sequences and none have been confirmed to date.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
6,Is it true that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats?,"This is a hypothesis. The RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to that of other coronaviruses circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Taxonomically, SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus. Using molecular clock analysis, betacoronaviruses are reported to have originated about 3,300 BC. Bats are considered to be ideal hosts for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses.Sars-CoV-2 viruses isolated from different human COVID-19 patients are reported to have almost identical sequences and the sequences are reported to be 88% and 89.1% analogous with bat-SL-CoVZC45, and 96% analogous with BatCoV RaTG13. BatCoV RaTG13 was previously detected in the horseshoe bat, which is found in South and Southeast Asia and southern and central China.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
7,"If animals can catch the virus, can they infect people?","At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that pets, livestock, or zoo animals that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
8,Will this finding prompt additional testing of animals?,"No. This is an evolving situation, however, routine testing of zoo or domestic animals is not recommended at this time. Animal and public health officials may decide to test certain animals that are showing signs of illness consistent with those identified for COVID-19, but only in cases where more common causes for respiratory and/or gastrointestinal illness in those animals have been ruled out and when the affected animals have possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2 through an infected person or animal.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
9,How did the tiger contract COVID-19?,"Presumably, the tiger contracted SARS-CoV-2 from a zookeeper, who at the time of exposure had not yet developed symptoms of COVID-19.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
10,"If multiple great cats at the Bronx Zoo were showing clinical signs, why was only one tested?","Only one tiger was tested because the collection of diagnostic samples in big cats requires general anesthesia. Since all tigers and lions were exhibiting similar clinical signs of respiratory disease, the attending veterinarian believed it was in the best interest of the animals to limit the potential risks of general anesthesia to one tiger for diagnostics.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
11,What do we know about the zoo tiger sick with COVID-19 disease?,"On April 5, the US Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories announced a positive finding of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from one tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York City. This appears to be the first instance of a tiger being infected with COVID-19. On April 3, quantitative PCR testing for SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on duplicate respiratory tract samples from a four-year-old female Malayan tiger with respiratory signs that was living at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) Bronx Zoo was performed at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center and New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Presumptive positive results of that testing were confirmed by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory on April 4. The tiger was one of two Malayan tigers, two Amur tigers, and three African lions that developed respiratory signs over the course of a week; respiratory signs included a dry cough and, in some cases, wheezing, but no dyspnea or nasal or ocular discharge. Mild anorexia was also noted in some animals. All of the large cats are long-term residents of the zoo, do not have chronic medical conditions, and there have been no new animals introduced to the groups for several years. All other Amur and Malayan tigers, a snow leopard, cheetah, clouded leopard, Amur leopard, puma (Puma concolor), and serval at the zoo still appear healthy. The source of infection was presumed to be transmission from a zookeeper, who at the time of exposure had not yet developed symptoms of COVID-19. The zoo has been closed to the public since mid-March, and the first tiger began showing signs of being ill on March 27. All of these large cats are expected to recover. Other animals in other parts of the zoo have shown no clinical signs of disease. Enhanced biosecurity protocols have been implemented for staff caring for all nondomestic felids in the four zoos overseen by the WCS.Because infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 meets the criteria of an emerging disease, such cases are reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
12,"I’ve heard about research reports of cats, ferrets, and dogs being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and, in some cases, spreading it to other animals of the same species. What can you tell me about those reports?","Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively.

Only the 2 dogs and 1 cat mentioned above had positive results of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and none of the animals in quarantine had developed clinical signs of respiratory disease.To date, the CDC has not received any National Veterinary Service Laboratories (NVSL)-confirmed reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, and there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
14,Why are animals being tested when many people can’t get tested?,Animals are only being tested in rare circumstances and on a case-by-case basis after consultation with public health and animal health officials to determine if testing is needed.

15,Should any animal showing signs of respiratory or gastrointestinal illness be tested?,"The AVMA, USDA, CDC, American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD), and National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) do not recommend routine testing of animals for this virus. If a domestic animal becomes ill with respiratory or gastrointestinal signs, veterinarians are strongly encouraged to first test for common pathogens and conditions that are more likely to have caused such clinical signs.Discussion among key regulatory authorities and animal health experts (USDA, CDC, FDA, NASPHV, National Assembly of State Animal Health Officials [NASAHO], AVMA) indicates that testing may be justified for certain animals in the following situations:Because the situation is ever-evolving, animal and public health officials may decide to test certain animals meeting the above criteria. The decision to test will be made collaboratively between the attending veterinarian and local, state, and federal public health and animal and health officials, and your veterinarian will contact one of those officials for information about how to proceed. If samples are sent to state animal health, university, or private laboratories for initial testing, all samples should be collected by a licensed, and preferably USDA-accredited, veterinarian in duplicate because positive samples must be confirmed through additional testing by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL). Different states may also have different requirements for testing and collaborating with and reporting to public health and animal health officials.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
16,"What are the criteria for testing animals owned by, or in close contact with, people ill with COVID-19 in the United States?","If a domestic animal becomes ill with respiratory or gastrointestinal signs, veterinarians will first test for common pathogens and conditions that are more likely to have caused such clinical signs. If the results of tests for any of these common pathogens or conditions are positive, then the veterinarian will recommend treatment and care for that animal accordingly.If the results of tests for more common pathogens and conditions are negative, the veterinarian should contact a local, state, or federal public health or animal health official for information about how to proceed. Any decision to test an animal for SARS-CoV-2 will be made collaboratively with these officials and testing will generally only be done if there has been close contact between the animal and a COVID-19 positive person or if there is exposure of the animal to a high-risk environment where a human outbreak occurred, such as residence, facility (e.g., nursing home, prison), or cruise ship.

17,What should I do if I think my animal has the virus?,"Call your veterinarian with any questions about your animal’s health. You should tell them why you are concerned about your animal being ill (e.g., what clinical signs of illness you are seeing) and whether the animal has had close contact with someone who has been sick with COVID-19. Calling your veterinarian in advance will help your veterinarian determine whether your animal needs to be seen immediately and, if so, will support the veterinary clinic/hospital in preparing for the proper admittance of that animal, including the preparation of an isolation area as needed. Do not take the animal to a veterinary clinic/hospital until you have consulted with your veterinarian. A telemedicine consultation should be considered as an option as well.After an examination and evaluation of the animal to rule out more likely causes for the animal’s illness, veterinarians who believe an animal should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 will contact local, state, or federal public health or animal health officials, who will work with them to determine next steps.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS

21,My pet or service animal needs to go to the veterinarian and I am ill with COVID-19—what should I do?,"If you are sick with COVID-19 or another communicable disease, you should stay at home, minimizing contact with other people, until you are well. Accordingly, if this is a non-urgent appointment for your pet or service animal consider rescheduling that appointment until your physician and/or your public health official believe you no longer present a risk of transmitting your infection to other people you may encounter during such a visit, including owners of pets or other animals and veterinary clinic staff. If you are sick with COVID-19, and you believe your pet or service animal is ill, you should seek assistance from your veterinarian to determine how to best ensure your pet or service animal can be appropriately cared for while minimizing risks of transmitting COVID-19 to other people.Don’t forget—if you have an established relationship with your veterinarian (i.e., they have seen your pet/service animal in the recent past), telemedicine can be an excellent way to connect you, your pet/service animal, and your veterinarian. It can be used to help determine the urgency with which an animal needs to be seen, whether the animal needs to be seen in-person, and can also be used to conduct rechecks of certain types of ongoing medical problems. If this is your first visit to the veterinarian, it may also be possible to conduct your appointment via telemedicine, depending on what services are needed and any discretion that is being applied by regulatory officials under the COVID-19 emergency for the practice of veterinary medicine in your state.Be sure to contact your veterinarian before heading to the veterinary clinic/hospital to see what they recommend for your situation.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
22,"If I am ill with COVID-19 are there special precautions I should take to prevent spreading disease, including when caring for my pet?","If you are sick with COVID-19 you need to be careful to avoid transmitting it to other people. Applying some common-sense measures can help prevent that from happening. Stay at home except to get medical care and call ahead before visiting your doctor. Minimize your contact with other people, including separating yourself from other members of your household who are not ill; use a different bathroom, if available; and wear a cloth face mask when you are around other people or pets and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. Wash your hands often, especially before touching your face, and use hand sanitizer. Use a tissue if you need to cough or sneeze and dispose of that tissue in the trash. When coughing or sneezing, do so into your elbow or sleeve. The AVMA recommends you take the same common-sense approach when interacting with your pets or other animals in your home, including service animals. You should tell your physician and public health official that you have a pet or other animal in your home. As a precaution, it is recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. So, if you are ill with COVID-19, have another member of your household take care of walking, feeding, and playing with your pet. If you have a service animal or you must care for your pet, then wear a cloth face covering; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with your pet or service animal. You should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with other people or pets in your home. Cats belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 should also be kept indoors as much as possible. While we are recommending these as good practices, there is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
23,"Should I avoid contact with animals, including pets, if I am sick with COVID-19?","You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would restrict contact with other people. Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if possible. If you have a service animal or you must care for your animals, then wear a cloth face covering; don’t share food, kiss, or hug them; and wash your hands before and after any contact with them.

Do not take the animal to a veterinary clinic/hospital until you have consulted with your veterinarian, especially if you are personally ill with COVID-19. And, of course, a telemedicine consultation should be considered as an option as well.If your pet gets sick, it is unlikely that it is because it has COVID-19; there is most likely a different cause for its illness.

25,My pet or service animal is not ill but has a scheduled appointment at the veterinarian and I am not ill with COVID-19—what should I do?,"If you are not ill with COVID-19 or another communicable disease (e.g., cold, flu) and your pet is not ill, call your veterinarian to discuss whether and when an in-person visit is best conducted. Given current efforts to reduce the potential for human exposure to COVID-19, including recommendations for social distancing, your veterinarian may recommend postponing non-urgent visits or procedures. If you would prefer to remain in your home and you have an established relationship with the veterinarian (i.e., they have seen your pet/service animal in the recent past), telemedicine might be an excellent way to conduct your visit, depending on what services are required. If this is your first visit to the veterinarian, it may also be possible to conduct your appointment via telemedicine, depending on what services are needed and any discretion that is being applied by regulatory officials under the COVID-19 emergency for the practice of veterinary medicine in your state. Your veterinarian can help you determine what kind of appointment might work best for you and your pet/service animal in your situation.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
26,What should I do to prepare for my pet’s care in the event I become ill?,"Identify another person in your household who is willing and able to care for your pet in your home should you contract COVID-19. Make sure you have an emergency kit prepared, with at least two weeks’ worth of your pet’s food and any needed medications. Usually we think about emergency kits like this in terms of what might be needed for an evacuation in the case of a disaster, but it’s also good to have one prepared in the case of quarantine or self-isolation when you cannot leave your home.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
27,Is it safe to walk my dog? What should I do/not do during that walk?,"Taking a walk helps support you and your dog’s good health, and can contribute to wellbeing for both of you. To observe social distancing, keep space of at least 6 feet between yourself and others who do not live in your home, do not gather in groups, and stay out of crowded areas. Dogs should be walked in the neighborhood in a way that allows for social distancing and keeps them safe. Avoid dog parks (many are currently closed) and other public places where groups of people and dogs may gather. To help maintain social distancing, do not let other people pet your dog when you are out for a walk.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
28,"Can pets’ fur, collars, leashes, and carriers serve as fomites for SARS-CoV-2?","COVID-19 appears to be primarily transmitted by contact with an infected person’s bodily secretions, such as saliva or mucus droplets in a cough or sneeze. It appears that COVID-19 can also be transmitted by touching a contaminated surface or object (i.e., a fomite) and then touching the mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, but this seems to be a secondary route. Smooth (non-porous) surfaces (e.g., countertops, doorknobs) transmit viruses better than porous materials (e.g., paper money, pet fur). Because your pet’s hair is porous, and fibrous, it is unlikely that you would contract COVID-19 by petting or playing with your pet. And, while we know that certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, we have no examples of where viruses have been transmitted by contact with pet hair or skin, including SARS-CoV-2. However, because pets can spread other diseases to people and people can also spread diseases to animals, it’s always a good idea to wash your hands before and after interacting with pets. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.While risk of transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from collars, leashes, and carriers also appears to be limited, it’s always a good idea to keep pet collars, leashes, and carriers clean and, fortunately, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is susceptible to routine cleaning. The Environmental Protection Agency has published a list of wipes, ready-to-use, and dilutable products for use against SARS-CoV-2.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
29,Can pets spread COVID-19?,"Infectious disease experts, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), indicate there is currently no evidence to suggest that animals incidentally infected by humans, including pets, play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person contact.COVID-19 appears to be primarily transmitted by contact with an infected person’s bodily secretions, such as saliva or mucus droplets in a cough or sneeze.

Because we have no confirmed examples of where viruses have been transmitted by contact with pet hair or skin, the use of alcohol or hydrogen peroxide containing cleaning agents, hand sanitizers, or sanitizing wipes to clean your pet’s fur or paws in an effort to prevent contracting COVID-19 is not recommended and may be harmful.",https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/covid-19-faq-pet-owners.pdf,en,COVID-19: FAQs FOR PET OWNERS
30,What research studies are being conducted to support treatments for COVID-19 in people?,"Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The US National Library of Medicine Clinical Trials database lists more than 380 drug (including convalescent plasma), device, biologic, and other trials for COVID-19. The FDA is posting frequent updates on therapeutic trials and enforcement actions against fraudulent claims.Scientists around the world are participating in a platform, Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY), that is examining approximately 30 treatments believed to have potential.Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection are being explored, using high doses of virus.

33,"Can you safely reuse a non-cloth mask that you can’t wash, like a disposable mask?","Yes you can, said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, an infectious diseases professor at Yale School of Medicine. 
To disinfect masks that you can’t wash, Vinetz recommends leaving them in a clean, safe place in your home for a few days. After that, it should no longer be infectious, as this coronavirus is known to survive on hard surfaces for only up to three days. 
You can reuse cloth masks, too. Just launder them between each use on a high-heat setting.

34,"What’s so different about coronavirus that we have to shut down businesses? Why practice social distancing now, when we didn’t during the SARS and swine flu epidemics?","Unlike SARS and swine flu, the novel coronavirus is both highly contagious and especially deadly, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. 
“SARS was also a coronavirus, and it was a new virus at the time,” Gupta said. “In the end, we know that SARS ended up infecting 8,000 people around the world and causing around 800 deaths. So very high fatality rate, but it didn’t turn out to be very contagious.”
The swine flu, or H1N1, “was very contagious and infected some 60 million people in the United States alone within a year,” Gupta said. “But it was far less lethal than the flu even — like 1/3 as lethal as the flu.” 
What makes the novel coronavirus different is that “this is both very contagious … and it appears to be far more lethal than the flu as well,” Gupta said. “So both those things, in combination I think, are why we’re taking this so seriously.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"

President Donald Trump wondered aloud during a press conference whether there’s “a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning.”

36,What can we learn from how other countries handled coronavirus?,"Singapore was initially praised for its clampdown on the virus. Even people who had no symptoms but tested positive had to be hospitalized until they tested negative. 
But Singapore was also relaxed, allowing businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open during its first wave of the virus. And some communities were overlooked by government testing.
The number of cases in Singapore shot up, and the country suffered a strong second wave of coronavirus. 
By contrast, Germany, South Korea, Iceland and Taiwan have been able to suppress the virus. They also have among the lowest death rates from Covid-19 in the world. 
Taiwan was proactive, launching its Central Epidemic Command Center before the island even confirmed its first infection. 
Iceland required all its citizens returning to the country to undergo 14 days of quarantine – regardless of which country they traveled from.
Germany and South Korea quickly launched widespread testing and have some of the highest per-capita testing rates in the world.

37,"Can coronavirus stick to clothes? Do I need to wash my clothes right after encountering other people, like at the grocery store or while jogging?","“I don’t think you need to,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. 
Coronavirus can stay alive for up to three days on stainless steel and plastic. But clothing “is probably more like cardboard — it’s more absorbent, so the virus is unlikely to stay and last that long,” Gupta said. 
While covonravirus can stay alive on cardboard for up to 24 hours, viruses generally don’t stick well on surfaces that are in motion. 
“If you look at how viruses move through air, they kind of want to move around objects,” Gupta said. “They don’t want to necessarily land on objects. So if you’re moving as human body through the air … (it’s) unlikely to stick to your clothes.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
38,"Can coronavirus spread through water, like in a swimming pool or hot tub?","“There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread to humans through the use of pools and hot tubs,” the CDC says. 
“Proper operation, maintenance, and disinfection (e.g., with chlorine and bromine) of pools and hot tubs should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”
But health officials still advise staying at least 6 feet away from others because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. In other words, you probably won’t get coronavirus from the water, but you could get coronavirus from someone close to you in the water. 
As for drinking water, doctors say you don’t need to worry about coronavirus in the tap water because most municipal drinking water systems should remove or inactivate the virus.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
39,Will an antibody test show whether I’m immune and can go back to work?,"Not necessarily. Antibodies are a body’s response to bacteria or viruses. But this novel coronavirus is so new, it’s still not clear whether having antibodies to it means you have long-term protection from getting reinfected. 
“The thing we don’t know yet is what is the relationship between the level of antibody and the degree of your protection,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Snapchat’s “Good Luck America” show. 
“So you may be positive for an antibody, but not enough to protect you.”

40,Can I use vodka as hand sanitizer?,"Please don’t. The CDC advises using hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Vodka typically contains between 35% and 46% percent alcohol.
If the stores are out of hand sanitizer and you want to make your own, the Nebraska Medical Center offers this recipe:
What you’ll need:

2/3 cup 91% isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol)
1/3 cup aloe vera gel
Mixing bowl
Spoon or something for whisking
Small container, such as a 3-oz. travel bottle
Optional: essential oil to give your hand sanitizer a fragrance

Directions:In a mixing bowl, stir isopropyl alcohol and aloe vera gel together until well blended.Add 8-10 drops of scented essential oil (optional, but nice).

41,Are smokers or vapers at higher risk? What if I only smoke weed?,"This is not a good time to be vaping or smoking anything, including weed. 
“Vaping affects your lungs at every level. It affects the immune function in your nasal cavity by affecting cilia, which push foreign things out,” said Prof. Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Research Control and Education at University of California San Francisco.
When you vape, “the ability of your upper airways to clear viruses is compromised,” Glantz said.
Tobacco smokers are at especially high risk. In a study from China, where the first Covid-19 outbreak occurred, smokers were 14 times more likely to develop severe complications than non-smokers.
Even occasionally smoking marijuana can put you at greater risk.
“What happens to your airways when you smoke cannabis is that it causes some degree of inflammation, very similar to bronchitis, very similar to the type of inflammation that cigarette smoking can cause,” said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association.
“Now you have some airway inflammation, and you get an infection on top of it. So yes, your chance of getting more complications is there.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
42,Can I get coronavirus through food? Is it safe to eat takeout from restaurants?,"There’s no evidence that coronavirus can be transmitted through food, the CDC says. 
Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.
“When you eat any kind of food, whether it be hot or cold, that food is going to go straight down into your stomach, where there’s a high acidity, low-pH environment that will inactivate the virus,” she said.
But it’s a good idea to disinfect the takeout containers, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus, and it’s easy to touch your face without realizing it.
If you don’t have disinfecting wipes, use your own plates or bowls to serve the food. Just make sure to wash your hands after transferring food from the containers.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
43,My teenagers aren’t taking this seriously. Any advice?,"Coronavirus isn’t just infecting young people. It’s killing young, healthy people as well. 
We’ve reported many stories about young people getting severely sick with or dying from coronavirus.
Dimitri Mitchell, 18, admits he had a “false sense of security.” But he was later hospitalized with coronavirus and now wants everyone to take it seriously. 
“I just want to make sure everybody knows that no matter what their age is, it can seriously affect them. And it can seriously mess them up, like it messed me up,” the Iowa teen said. 
He started feeling sick on St. Patrick’s Day, with just a small cough. “I thought at first it was just a normal cold. And then it started progressively getting worse,” he said. 
“Four days in, the really bad symptoms started coming along. I started having really bad outbreaks, like sweating, and my eyes were really watery. I was getting warmer and warmer, and I was super fatigued. … I would start experiencing the worst headaches I’ve ever felt in my life. They were absolutely horrible.”
Eventually, the teen had to be hospitalized. His mother said she worried he might “fall asleep and never wake up.” 
Mitchell is now recovering, but still has a cough almost a month later. 
“I just hope everybody’s responsible, because it’s nothing to joke about,” he said. “It’s a real problem, and I want everybody to make sure they’re following social distancing guidelines and the group limits.

45,My ex and I have joint custody of our kids. Is it safe for them to go between two homes?,"Ideally, you should limit your children’s potential exposures to coronavirus and work out the safest plan possible with your ex. 
The problem: Most state and county family courts are closed, or open only for emergencies involving abuse or endangerment. So if parents wanted to formally modify pre-existing custody agreements, they can’t.
But some states may be offering some flexibility during the pandemic.

46,How long does coronavirus stay “alive” on surfaces?,"Up to three days, depending on the surface. According to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health:

The novel coronavirus is viable up to 72 hours after being placed on stainless steel and plastic.
It was viable up to four hours after being placed on copper, and up to 24 hours after being put on cardboard.

47,Will a pneumonia or flu vaccine help protect against coronavirus?,"Some cases of coronavirus do lead to pneumonia. But the pneumonia vaccine won’t help.
“Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, only help protect people from these specific bacterial infections,” according to Harvard Medical School.
“They do not protect against any coronavirus pneumonia.”
The flu shot does not protect against coronavirus. But it does help protect against a massive, unnecessary burden on hospitals already overwhelmed with coronavirus.
The CDC estimates about 140,000 to 810,000 people are hospitalized with the flu every year in the US. And about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated – including most children who die from the flu.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
48,Why are medical workers getting sick with or dying from coronavirus if they’re wearing protective gear? Does the viral load matter?,"Many health care workers don’t actually have enough protective gear to handle the growing influx of coronavirus patients. 
Some have resorted to using plastic report covers as masks. The CDC said medical providers might have to use expired masks or reuse them between multiple patients. (This shortage is why the general public should not buy medical masks and instead make cloth masks at home.)
But it’s not just subpar protective gear that puts medical workers at risk. It’s also the amount of virus they’re exposed to. 
“The viral load — the amount of virus – does determine the severity of your illness,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said. “So that could happen in the case of health care workers who are exposed to a lot more Covid-19 as a result of their work — that they get more severely ill.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
49,How many people with coronavirus don't have symptoms? Are they still contagious?,"In one study, about 4 in 5 people with confirmed coronavirus in China were likely infected by people who didn’t know they had it, according to research published in the journal “Science.”
“These findings explain the rapid geographic spread of (coronavirus) and indicate containment of this virus will be particularly challenging,” researchers wrote.
In mid-March, the CDC said almost half of the 712 people with coronavirus who were on the Diamond Princess cruise ship didn’t have any symptoms when they tested positive.
And recent studies suggest 25% to 50% of coronavirus carriers don’t have symptoms.
In the US, “I think it could be as many as 1 in 3 walking around asymptomatic,” said New Jersey primary care physician Dr. Alex Salerno.
“We have tested some patients that have known exposure to COVID (coronavirus disease). They did not have temperature. Their pulse/(oxygen) was OK.”
Aside from social distancing and frequent hand washing, Salerno said more testing of people without symptoms is essential.
When asymptomatic carriers test positive, “we isolate them, and we separate them from the people who are not positive,” Salerno said. If more asymptomatic people got tested, “we could get people back to work safely.”
But there haven’t been nearly enough tests in the US for everyone who wants one, due to shortages, delays and faulty test kits.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
50,"If there’s no cure, why go to the hospital unless you have a breathing problem?","Most coronavirus patients don’t need to be hospitalized. “The vast majority of people – about 80% – will do well without any specific intervention,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Those patients should get plenty of rest, hydrate frequently and take fever-reducing medication.
“The current guidance – and this may change – is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them,” said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. 
But about 20% of coronavirus patients get advanced disease. “Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,” the CDC says.
The CDC also says you should get immediate help if you have: 

Trouble breathing
Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
Sudden confusion

“The COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water,” the CDC says. “Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”

                So it’s critical to play it safe and not infect yourself and, in turn, others. The CDC suggests: 

Giving the sick person their own room to stay in, if possible. Keep the door closed.
Having only one person serve as the caretaker.

“Unexpired household bleach will be effective against coronaviruses when properly diluted” if you’re trying to kill coronavirus on a non-porous surface, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. 
The CDC’s recipe calls for diluting 5 tablespoons (or ⅓ cup) of bleach per gallon of water, or 4 teaspoons of bleach per quart of water.

58,Should I stock up on extra food and supplies?,"Yes, because a family member may suddenly have to quarantine. Just don’t hoard more than you need because others need supplies, too. 
Harvard Medical School recommends keeping a two-week to 30-day supply of nonperishable food at home. And if you don’t use them now, they may come in handy for power outages or extreme weather. 
It’s also a good idea to keep at least a 30-day supply of prescription medications you may need, though it can be difficult to get them early. Consider mail-ordering medications.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
59,Should I avoid public transportation?,"If you rely on public transportation, use caution. If you’re sick or live in an area where an outbreak has been reported, avoid it. 
Mass transit could increase your risk of exposure to coronavirus. Luckily, transit systems are upping their cleaning regimens — notably the New York subway system. 
Dr. Robyn Gershon, a professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Public Health, has some tips: When you ride a bus or subway, sneeze or cough into your elbow. Use a tissue to hold onto a pole. Avoid touching your face while you’re riding, and use hand sanitizer if you have it while you’re commuting. 
Again, wash your hands before, during and after your trip. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recommends letting crowded trains or buses pass and waiting for a less crowded one. It’s nearly impossible to maintain 6 feet of distance on a packed subway car. 
If you have a chronic illness, find alternative means of transportation — being in a crowded subway car or bus will significantly increase your risk of infection.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
60,Can I be fired if I stay home sick?,"An employee can be fired if they don’t show up to work and they don’t have sick leave that would cover the absence, says Krista Slosburg, an employment attorney at Stokes Lawrence in Seattle.  
But there are exceptions.
Employers that make workers with coronavirus come in may be violating Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA] regulations, according to Donna Ballman, who heads an employee advocacy law firm in Florida.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
61,What happens when workers don't get paid sick leave?,"If you work in a city or state that requires sick leave and you use it, you can‘t be terminated or disciplined. 
But there is no federal mandate that requires companies to offer paid sick leave, and almost a quarter of all US workers don’t get it, according to 2019 government data. Some state and local governments have passed laws that require companies to offer paid sick leave.
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) can sometimes protect a worker’s job in the event they get sick, but it won’t guarantee they get paid while they’re out. 
Employee advocates urge businesses to consider the special circumstances of the coronavirus, and some already have.

62,Can managers send a sick worker home?,"Yes, managers can. 
The Society for Human Resource Management recommends companies “actively encourage sick employees to stay home, send symptomatic employees home until they are able to return to work safely, and require employees returning from high-risk areas to telework during the incubation period [of 14 days].”
If a manager feels an employee’s illness poses a direct threat to colleagues’ safety, the manager may be able to insist the employee be evaluated by a doctor, said Alka Ramchandani-Raj, an attorney specializing in workplace safety.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
63,"If traveling on a plane, how do I stay safe?","It’s not the cabin air you need to worry about. It’s keeping your hands clean. 
Always be mindful of where your hands have been, travel medicine specialist Dr. Richard Dawood said. 
Airport handrails, door handles and airplane lavatory levers are notoriously dirty. 
“It is OK to touch these things as long as you then wash or sanitize your hands before contaminating your face, touching or handling food,” Dawood said. 
“Hand sanitizers are great. So are antiseptic hand wipes, which you can also use to wipe down armrests, remote controls at your seat and your tray table.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
64,"Since a plane's cabin keeps circulating air, will I get sick if another passenger is sick?","Most viruses don’t spread easily on airplanes because of how the air circulates and is filtered, the CDC says. 
Modern commercial jets recirculate 10-50% of the air in the cabin, mixed with outside air. 
                “The recirculated air passes through a series of filters 20-30 times per hour,” the CDC says. 
“Furthermore, air generally circulates in defined areas within the aircraft, thus limiting the radius of distribution of pathogens spread by small-particle aerosols. As a result, the cabin air environment is not conducive to the spread of most infectious diseases.”
Still, try to avoid contact with anyone sneezing or coughing. And if you’re feeling sick, cover your entire mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow when you cough or sneeze.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
65,"If I have a weakened immune system, should I cancel my travel plans?","People who are immunocompromised “are at higher risk from this illness, as well as other illnesses like the flu. Avoiding contact with ill people is crucial,” Washington state’s Snohomish Health District said. 
“While rates of infection may not differ significantly between healthy and immunocompromised travelers, the latter are at greater risk for severe disease,” according to researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
66,What do I do if I think I’m sick?,"Stay home. Call your doctor to talk about your symptoms and let them know you’re coming for an appointment so they can prepare for your visit, the CDC says. 
Only a Covid-19 test can diagnose you with the virus, but if you suspect you have it, isolate yourself at home. 
Many patients with coronavirus are able to recover at home. If you’ve been diagnosed and your illness is worsening, seek medical attention promptly. You may need to be monitored in a hospital. 
Ask your physician to call the local or state health department, too, so they’re aware that you’re being monitored for the virus.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
67,Should I spray myself or my kids with disinfectant?,"No. Those products work on surfaces but can be dangerous to your body. 
There are some chemical disinfectants, including bleach, 75% ethanol, peracetic acid and chloroform, that may kill the virus on surfaces. 
But if the virus is already in your body, putting those substances on your skin or under your nose won’t kill it, the World Health Organization says. Not to mention, those chemicals can harm you. 
And please – do not ingest chemical disinfectants.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
68,Why waste a test kit on a person without symptoms?,"Some people with coronavirus have mild or no symptoms. And in some cases, symptoms don’t appear until up to 14 days after infection. 
During that incubation period, it’s possible to get coronavirus from someone with no symptoms. It’s also possible you may have coronavirus without feeling sick and are accidentally infecting others. 
So anyone who has had close contact with someone known to have coronavirus should ask a health care provider about getting tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
69,Why is the US so far behind other countries with testing?,"Experts say it’s due to cuts in federal funding for public health and problems with early testing. 
Problems with public health infrastructure Two years ago, the CDC stopped funding epidemic prevention activities in 39 countries, including China. This happened because the Trump administration refused to allocate money to a program that started during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. 
Former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden warned that move “would significantly increase the chance an epidemic will spread without our knowledge and endanger lives in our country and around the world.”
Problems with the testing Malfunctions, shortages and delays in availability have all contributed to the slowdown. 
In the first few weeks of the outbreak in the US, the CDC was the only facility in the country that could confirm test results — even though a World Health Organization test became available around the same time. 
Some test kits that were sent around the country were flawed — a move that put the US behind about “four to five weeks,” says Dr. Rob Davidson, executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
70,"If a coronavirus patient progresses to pneumonia, what antibiotics if any have proven to be effective?","No, antibiotics are not effective against coronavirus because the disease is a viral infection, not a bacterial infection. 
“However, if you are hospitalized for the [coronavirus], you may receive antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible,” the World Health Organization says. 
There is no known cure for the coronavirus. Researchers are studying whether the antiviral drug remdesivir might work, but testing of that drug just started.
For now, coronavirus patients get “supportive” treatment, “which means giving fluids, medicine to reduce fever, and, in severe cases, supplemental oxygen,” the Harvard Medical School says.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
71,Did Dean Koontz predict this outbreak in the book “The Eyes of Darkness” almost 40 years ago?,"No. There are some interesting coincidences in the 1981 fiction novel, which says “a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread around the globe” around the year 2020. Modern editions of the book call the biological strain “Wuhan-400,” and the current coronavirus outbreak started in Wuhan, China.
But there are important differences between the book and reality. The original version of the book called the strain the “Gorki-400,” in reference to a Russian locality, before it was later changed to the “Wuhan-400.” In the book, the virus was man-made, while scientists believe the novel coronavirus started in animals and jumped to humans. And in the book, the virus had a 100% mortality rate. Early estimates of the mortality rate for this coronavirus outbreak range from 2-4%.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
72,Can the heat from a hand dryer kill coronavirus?,"Hand dryers can’t kill the virus, according to WHO. The organization also says that UV lamps shouldn’t be used to sterilize hands or other areas of the body because the radiation can irritate skin.
Drinking hot water or taking hot baths won’t kill it, either.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
73,Can I get coronavirus from a package sent from China?,"No. “The new coronavirus cannot be transmitted through goods manufactured in China or any country reporting Covid-19 cases,” the World Health Organization says. 
“Even though the new coronavirus can stay on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days (depending on the type of surface), it is very unlikely that the virus will persist on a surface after being moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperatures,” WHO said. 
Again, the best ways to prevent transmission is to stay 6 feet away from others, thoroughly wash your hands, and disinfect surfaces with EPA-approved products.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
74,When are people with coronavirus most contagious?,"“People can be contagious without symptoms. And in fact – a little bit strangely in this case — people tend to be the most contagious before they develop symptoms, if they’re going to develop symptoms,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.
“They call that the pre-symptomatic period. So people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. This is even before they get sick. And they can be shedding that virus into the environment.”
Some people infected with coronavirus never get symptoms. But it’s easy for these asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Dr. Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA’s School of Public Health.
“When you speak, sometimes you’ll spit a little bit,” she said. “You’ll rub your nose. You’ll touch your mouth. You’ll rub your eyes. And then you’ll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.”
That’s why health officials suggest everyone wear a face mask while in public.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
75,Are coronavirus and Covid-19 the same thing? How did they get their names?,"Coronavirus and Covid-19 are not the same thing, but sometimes the terms can be used interchangeably. 
This “novel coronavirus” is novel because it just emerged in humans in late 2019. There have been six other coronaviruses known to infect humans, such as SARS (circa 2003) and MERS (circa 2012).
“Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface,” or coronas, the CDC says. The scientific name for this novel coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, which stands for “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.”
Covid-19, however, is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The letters and numbers in “Covid-19” come from “Coronavirus disease 2019.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
76,Doesn’t the flu kill more people than coronavirus?,"No. More people have died from coronavirus in the US since February than from the flu since October. 
In other words, coronavirus isn’t just killing more people than the flu. It’s also killing at a much faster rate.
From October 1 to April 4, an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 Americans died from the flu, according to CDC. 
The first known US death from coronavirus was in February. By May 13, more than 83,600 people have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
There are other reasons why coronavirus can be more dangerous than the flu:

Coronavirus is twice as contagious as the flu. Research indicates a person with the flu infects an average of 1.28 other people, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. But with coronavirus, “it’s likely between 2 and 3” other people. But mitigation efforts such as stay-at-home orders can drastically reduce that number. 
Coronavirus can be spread unknowingly for many more days than the flu. People with coronavirus might not get symptoms for 14 days, and some get no symptoms at all. But during that time, they’re still contagious and can infect others unknowingly. But the incubation period for the flu is much shorter, and most people get symptoms within two days of infection.
A vaccine is available for the flu, but no vaccine is available for coronavirus. Experts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got their flu shots. But about half of Americans don’t get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
77,Can coronavirus be transferred by people’s shoes? How do I protect children who crawl or play on the floor?,"Yes, coronavirus can live on the soles of shoes, but the risk of getting Covid-19 from shoes appears to be low.
A report published by the CDC highlighted a study from a hospital in Wuhan, China, where this coronavirus outbreak began. 
The soles of medical workers’ shoes were swabbed and analyzed, and the study found that the virus was “widely distributed” on floors, computer mice, trash cans and door knobs. But it’s important to note the study was done in a hospital, where the virus was concentrated. 
It’s still possible to pick up coronavirus on the bottoms of your shoes by running errands, but it’s unlikely you’ll get sick from it because people don’t often touch the soles of their shoes and then their faces. Because Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, the CDC advises wearing a mask while in public and washing your hands frequently– the correct way. 
If you have small children who crawl or regularly touch the floor, it’s a good idea to take your shoes off as soon you get home to prevent coronavirus or bacteria from spreading on the floors.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
78,"How does soap kill coronavirus? If I don’t have disinfecting wipes, can I use soap and water on surfaces?","Yes, you can use soap and water on surfaces just like you would on your hands to kill coronavirus. But don’t use water alone — that won’t really help. 
The outer layer of the virus is made up of lipids, aka fat. Your goal is to break through that fatty barrier, forcing the virus’ guts to spill out and rendering it dead. 
In other words, imagine coronavirus is a butter dish that you’re trying to clean. 
“You try to wash your butter dish with water alone, but that butter is not coming off the dish,” said Dr. John Williams, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
“You need some soap to dissolve grease. So soap or alcohol are very, very effective against dissolving that greasy liquid coating of the virus.”
By cutting through the greasy barrier, Williams said, “it physically inactivates the virus so it can’t bind to and enter human cells anymore.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
79,Should I wash my hands and laundry in very warm or hot water?,"Hot water is best for killing bacteria and viruses in your laundry. But you don’t want to use that kind of scalding hot water on your skin. 
Warm water is perfectly fine for washing your hands — as long as you wash them thoroughly (like this) and for at least 20 seconds. (To time yourself, you can hum the “Happy Birthday” song twice or sing a couple of verses from any of these hit songs from the past several decades.)
Cold water will also work, “but you have to make sure you work really vigorously to get a lather and get everything soapy and bubbly,” said chemist Bill Wuest, an associate professor at Emory University. To do that, you might need to sing “Happy Birthday” three times instead of twice. 
“Warm water with soap gets a much better lather – more bubbles,” Wuest said. “It’s an indication that the soap is … trying to encapsulate the dirt and the bacteria and the viruses in them.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"

Most of those infections came from contact with people who had coronavirus, like a zoo employee who was an asymptomatic carrier. 
But according to the CDC, there is no evidence animals play a significant role in spreading the virus to humans. Therefore, at this time, routine testing of animals for Covid-19 is not recommended.
As always, it’s best to wash your hands after touching an animal’s fur and before touching your face.

82,Can I disinfect my mask by putting it in the microwave?,"That’s “not a great idea,” said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, a professor of infectious diseases at Yale School of Medicine. “We have no evidence about that.” 
“If there’s a metal piece in an N95 or surgical mask and even staples, you can’t microwave them,” he said. “It’ll blow up.”
Vinetz said cloth masks can be washed and reused, and even disposable masks can be reused if you let them sit for several days. 
To disinfect masks that you can’t wash, Vinetz recommends leaving them in a clean, safe place in your home for a few days. After that, it should no longer be infectious, as this coronavirus is known to survive on hard surfaces for only up to three days.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
83,Can coronavirus stay in my hair or in a beard? Should I wash my hair every day?,"Coronavirus can stick to hair, said Dr. David Aronoff, director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. 
Touching contaminated hair and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose could increase your risk of infection. “Like on the skin, this coronavirus is a transient hitchhiker that can be removed by washing,” Aronoff said.
But that doesn’t mean you have to wash the hair on your head multiple times a day, said dermatologist Dr. Hadley King. 
That’s because “living hair attached to our scalps may be better protected by our natural oils that have some antimicrobial properties and may limit how well microbes can attach to the hair,” she said. 
“If you are going out into areas that could possibly be contaminated with viral particles, then it would be reasonable to wash the hair daily during the pandemic. But it’s not the same as hand washing – the virus infects us through our mucosal surfaces.  If your hair is not falling into your face or you’re not running your fingers through it, then there is less of a risk.”
If your hair does fall into your face, you may want to pull it back to minimize your risk, King said.
As for facial hair, “washing at least daily if not more frequently is wise, depending on how often they touch their face,” Aronoff said.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
84,Do I need to wash fruits and vegetables with soap and water?,"No. The US Food and Drug Administration says you don’t need to wash fresh produce with soap and water, but you should rinse it with plain water. 
But it’s still important to wash your hands with soap and water frequently because we often touch our faces without realizing it. And that’s a very easy way for coronavirus to spread. 
You don’t have to worry about getting coronavirus by “eating” it, though. Even if coronavirus does get into your food, your stomach acid would kill it, said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
85,My kids don’t want to wear a mask. What should I do?,"Children can be more reluctant because they’re more sensitive to new things than adults are, said Christopher Willard, a psychiatry lecturer at Harvard Medical School.
“There’s also the weird psychological aspect of not being able to see their own face or other people’s faces and facial expressions,” which can hinder their feelings of comfort or safety, he said.
To ease their mask fears, try buying or making masks with fun designs on them. Or have your child customize his or her own mask by drawing on them with markers.
You can also order children’s face masks with superheroes on them or show your kids photos of their favorite celebrities wearing masks.
It’s also important to set a good example by wearing a mask yourself. Show your children your own mask, and let them know that by wearing one, they’ll be just like Mom or Dad.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
86,Is it safe to go back to the gym?,"There are definitely risks, but also steps you and the gym can take to help minimize the risks. 
Coronavirus often spreads more easily indoors rather than outdoors — especially if you’re indoors for an extended period of time. 
Researchers have also found that heavy breathing and singing can propel aerosolized viral particles farther and increase the risk of transmission. 
During one fitness instructor workshop, about 30 participants with no symptoms trained intensely for four hours, according to research published by the CDC. Eight participants later tested positive, and more than 100 new cases of coronavirus were traced back to that fitness workshop.
To help mitigate the risk, many gyms are now limiting capacity. Some are providing members with disinfectant sprays to sanitize equipment. 
While health experts have recommended staying 6 feet away from others, it’s smart to keep even more distance than that at the gym. 
“With all the heavy breathing, you may even want to double the usual 6 feet to 12 feet, just to be safe,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
87,Can you get coronavirus by touching a dead body or the ashes of someone who had Covid-19?,"It appears unlikely, but the CDC advises taking precautions.
Experts believe coronavirus is mainly spread during close contact (about 6 feet) with a person who is currently infected, the CDC said.
“This type of spread is not a concern after death,” the CDC said. But it cautions that “we are still learning how it spreads.”
“There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing,” the CDC said. 
“Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible.”
If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, “families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible,” the CDC said.
“At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).”
Cremated remains can be considered sterile, as infectious agents do not survive incineration-range temperatures, the CDC said.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
88,"Can you get coronavirus from touching money? What about from other objects, like plants?","“Viruses can live on surfaces and objects — including on money — although your chance of actually getting COVID-19 from cash is probably very low,” emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen said.
The new coronavirus can live for up to 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic, up to 24 hours after landing on cardboard, and up to four hours after landing on copper, according to a study funded by the US National Institutes of Health. 
So how do you protect yourself? To avoid touching cash or coins, use contactless methods of payment whenever possible, Wen said.
If you can’t use a contactless form of payment, credit cards and debit cards are much easier to clean and disinfect than cash. But remember that anyone who touches your credit card can also leave germs on it.
If you must use cash, “wash your hands well with soap and water” afterward, Wen said. 
The same applies for anything else you touch that might have coronavirus on it. If you can’t wash your hands immediately, use hand sanitzier or disinfectant.
And since Covid-19 is a respiratory disease, make sure you avoid touching your face.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
89,Can UV light kill coronavirus?,"While some UV light devices are used for hospital disinfection, UV light only kills germs under very specific conditions — including certain irradiation dosages and exposure times, the World Health Organization said. 
But UV light can also damage the body. 
Two factors are required for UV light to destroy a virus: intensity and time. If the light is intense enough to break apart a virus in a short time, it’s going to be dangerous to people, said Donald Milton, a professor at the University of Maryland. 
UVA and UVB light both damage the skin. UVC light is safer for skin, but it will damage tender tissue such as the eyes.
And don’t be fooled by claims that hot weather will kill coronavirus.
“You can catch COVID-19 no matter how sunny or hot the weather is,” the WHO said. “Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
90,I see other countries spraying down sidewalks and other public places with disinfectant. Why don’t we do that in the US?,"Randomly spraying open places is largely a waste of time, health experts say. 
It can actually do more harm than good. “Spraying disinfectants can result in risks to the eyes, respiratory or skin irritation,” the World Health Organization said.
“Spraying or fumigation of outdoor spaces, such as streets or marketplaces, is also not recommended to kill the COVID-19 virus or other pathogens because disinfectant is inactivated by dirt and debris, and it is not feasible to manually clean and remove all organic matter from such spaces,” the WHO said.
“Moreover, spraying porous surfaces, such as sidewalks and unpaved walkways, would be even less effective.” Besides, the ground isn’t typically a source of infection, the WHO said.
And once the disinfectant wears off, an infected person could easily contaminate the surface again.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
91,How can I stay safe in an elevator?,"It’s best to take the stairs if you can. But if you can’t, emergency room physician Dr. Leana Wen offers several tips: 

Wear a mask. Not only does wearing a mask reduce your risk of inhaling the virus — which can linger in the air for 8 minutes — it also helps reduce your chances of infecting others if you are an asymptomatic carrier.

92,"Can I get coronavirus from swimming in open water, like in a lake or seawater? What about in a public pool or hot tub?","It’s not the water you need to worry about. It’s how close you might get to other people.
“Properly maintained pool water will not be a source of spread of the virus. The chlorine that’s in it will inactivate the virus fairly quickly,” immunologist Erin Bromage said. 
“The level of dilution that would happen in a pool or an ocean or a large freshwater body would not lead to enough virus to establish an infection. But when you do this, you need to just make sure that we’re maintaining an appropriate physical distance while swimming or sitting in a hot tub.” 
That’s because it’s easy for infected people with no symptoms to spread the virus if they’re within 6 feet from each other. If you have an indoor pool or hot tub, even 6 feet might not be enough distance.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
93,Is it safe to perform CPR on a stranger?,"Doctors strongly recommend performing CPR when someone needs it.
You could be hundreds of times more likely to save that dying person’s life than you are to die from Covid-19 if you contract it after performing CPR, according to a report published by a group of Seattle emergency room physicians in the journal Circulation.
But it’s important to act quickly for CPR to be effective. 
“The chance of survival goes down by 10% for every minute without CPR,” said Dr. Comilla Sasson, vice president for science and innovation in emergency cardiovascular care at the American Heart Association. “It’s a 10-minute window to death in many cases.”
If you’re not certified in CPR, performing chest compressions could also buy more time until help arrives. Bystanders should “provide high-quality chest compressions by pushing hard and fast in the middle of the victim’s chest, with minimal interruptions,” the American Heart Association said.

95,Are some blood types able to fight this coronavirus better than other blood types?,"A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that people with Type A blood have a higher risk of getting infected with coronavirus and developing severe symptoms, while people with Type O blood have a lower risk – but the study has caveats.
The researchers cannot say if blood type is a direct cause of the differences in susceptibility. It could be that genetic changes that affect someone’s risk also just happen to be linked with blood type, they said.
The study’s findings, while plausible, may mean very little for the average person, said Dr. Roy Silverstein, a hematologist and chairman of the department of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin.
“The absolute difference in risk is very small,” he said. “The risk reduction may be statistically significant, but it is a small change in actual risk. You never would tell somebody who was Type O that they were at smaller risk of infection.”
The bottom line: “All of us are susceptible to this virus,” said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead for the World Health Organization’s Covid-19 response.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
96,Is hand sanitizer as effective as soap and water in killing coronavirus?,"Yes — as long as you use the right kind of sanitizer and use it correctly.
Hand sanitizers “need to have at least 60% alcohol in them,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. 
And don’t just put a little dollop in your hand and smear it around quickly. 
“You’ve got to use enough and get it all over the surfaces,” Schaffner said. “Rub it all over your hands, between your fingers and on the back of your hands.”
But it’s always better to thoroughly wash your hands, if you’re able to. 
“Alcohol is pretty effective at killing germs, but it doesn’t wash away stuff,” said Dr. John Williams, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.
“If somebody’s just sneezed into their hand, and their hand is covered with mucus, they would have to use a lot more alcohol to inactivate that bacteria or virus.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
97,How safe are public restrooms?,"“If you don’t have to use the public restroom, don’t,” said microbiologist Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists. But he acknowledged that’s not always possible: “Sometimes when you gotta go, you gotta go.”
Close contact with others is the most significant risk in a public restroom, Nouri said. So if there’s a single-person bathroom available that doesn’t have multiple stalls, using that might be best. 
If you do use a multi-stall public restroom, Nouri offers the following tips: 

Use paper towels to dry your hands, not the hand dryer. Air dryers can spread viral particles around the room. And paper towels have been shown to remove residual viral particles more effectively than air.
Don’t use your freshly washed hands to turn off the water with the germ-laden faucet handle. Instead, use a paper towel to turn off the water and open the bathroom door. Throw away the paper towel immediately afterward.
Wear a face mask. “Masks are one of the most effective ways to stop human-to-human transmission,” Nouri said. “If people in a public bathroom are not wearing masks, think twice before going in.” 
If the restroom looks crowded, wait until it clears out, if you can.  “You’re reducing the risk of inhaling aerosolized particles from other people,” Nouri said.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
98,Why has the guidance on wearing face masks changed so much?,"Earlier in this pandemic, scientists didn’t know how easily this new virus spreads between people without symptoms, nor did they know how long infectious particles could linger in the air. There was also a shortage of N95 respirators and face masks among health care workers who were quickly overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients.
But since then, the CDC, the US Surgeon General and other doctors have changed their recommendations and are now urging the widespread use of face masks. 
The CDC now says the public needs to “cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others.” 
“Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities,” the CDC said.  
Scientists have made many recent discoveries about this new coronavirus, including:

It’s easy to spread this virus by just talking or breathing. 
This coronavirus is highly contagious. Without mitigation efforts like stay-at-home orders, each person with coronavirus infects, on average, another two to three other people. That makes it twice as contagious as the flu. 
This virus has a long incubation period – up to 14 days – giving a wide window of opportunity for people to infect others before they even know they’re infected. 
Carriers may be most contagious in the 48 hours before they get symptoms, making transmission even more blind.

In other words, it’s not just people who are sneezing and coughing who can spread coronavirus. It’s often people who look completely normal and don’t have a fever. And that could include you.
If 95% of Americans wore face masks in public, it would save more than 33,000 lives by October 1, according to projections from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
99,"Should I wear a face mask in public? If so, how do I make one?","The CDC recently changed its guidance on wearing face masks as more studies about asymptomatic spread pile up.
Now, the CDC “recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies).”
But there are several important caveats and key points: 

The public should NOT buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those are desperately needed by health care workers who are in close contact with coronavirus patients every day. 
Instead, make your own cloth mask — it’s easy, and you don’t have to sew. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams shows how to make face masks with just a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. You can also use a bandana and a coffee filter. 
You can definitely still get coronavirus even if you wear a mask. The virus can stay alive on surfaces for up to 3 days, and it’s easy to touch your face whenever you’re not wearing a mask. Also, people often adjust face masks frequently, leading to more touching of the face — a common way that coronavirus spreads.
It’s important to wash your cloth mask after every use. Here’s how. 
Wearing cloth masks is just “an additional, voluntary public health measure,” the CDC said. To protect yourself from getting coronavirus, it’s critical to stay 6 feet away from others, wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds each time, and stop touching your face.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
100,Should people wear face shields instead of or in addition to masks?,"The CDC does not recommend using plastic face shields for everyday activities or as a substitute for face masks. There are a few exceptions, such as for those who are hearing-impaired and rely on on lip-reading or those who have physical or mental health conditions that would be exacerbated by wearing a cloth face mask. 
“Cloth face coverings are a critical preventive measure and are most essential in times when social distancing is difficult,” the CDC says.
Clinical and laboratory studies show cloth face coverings reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth – what the CDC refers to as “source control.” And many people are contagious even when they don’t have any symptoms and don’t know they’re infected. 
Face shields worn in addition to masks can provide an added layer of protection and can also help people stop touching their faces. Workers who are around people for long periods of time, such as grocery store workers or hospital personnel, may want to wear face shields in addition to masks, to increase their protection.
If someone must use a face shield without a mask, the CDC says the shield “should wrap around the sides of the wearer’s face and extend to below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be worn for a single use. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
101,Can central air conditioning spread Covid-19 in public places?,"Technically, it can, but HVAC (heating/ventilation/air conditioning) systems are not thought to be a significant factor in the spread of coronavirus. 
Many modern air conditioning systems will either filter out or dilute the virus. Ventilation systems with highly effective filters are a key way to eliminate droplets from the air, said Harvard environmental health researcher Joseph Gardner Allen.
Filters are rated by a MERV system –  their “minimum efficiency reporting value” that specifies their ability to trap tiny particles. The MERV ratings go from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the better the filtration. 
HEPA filters have the highest MERV ratings, between 17 and 20. HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases. They’re able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. 
For context, this new coronavirus is thought to be between 0.06 to 1.4 microns in size. 
But “HEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,” Allen said. “But there are other filters that can do the job. What is recommended now by the standard setting body for HVAC is a MERV 13 filter.” 
High-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 MERV range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important.
“If you’re an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest MERV number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,” advised Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.
“In addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,” Bromage said. “It’s worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
102,Should we clean our cell phones daily?,"Yes, that’s a good idea because cell phones are basically “petri dishes in our pockets” when you consider how many surfaces you touch before touching your phone.
You should regularly disinfect your mobile phone anyway, with or without a coronavirus pandemic. 
“There’s probably quite a lot of microorganisms on there, because you’re holding them against your skin, you are handling them all the time, and also you’re speaking into them,” said Mark Fielder, a professor of medical microbiology at Kingston University. 
“And speaking does release droplets of water just in normal speech. So it’s likely that a range of microbes – including Covid-19, should you happen to be infected with that virus – might end up on your phone.”

103,Do I still need to quarantine for 14 days after returning from travel?,"If you traveled internationally, the CDC says you should stay home for 14 days after returning home. During those 14 days, be sure to take these steps:

Take your temperature with a thermometer twice a day and monitor for a fever. You can use this temperature log to monitor your temperature. And watch for coughing or trouble breathing. 
Stay home and avoid contact with others. Do not go to work or school.
Do not use public transportation, taxis, or ride-share services.
Keep your distance from others (about 6 feet or 2 meters).

If you traveled domestically, it depends on the state. Some state or local governments require those who have recently traveled to stay home for 14 days. Covid-19 cases and deaths have been reported in all 50 states, and the situation is constantly changing. 
“Because travel increases your chances of getting infected and spreading COVID-19, staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick,” the CDC says.

104,What does asymptomatic mean?,"Asymptomatic describes a person who is infected but does not have symptoms. With Covid-19, asymptomatic carriers can still easily infect others without knowing it. So if you’re infected but don’t feel sick, you could still get others very sick. 
Some medical professionals differentiate between truly asymptomatic people – those who don’t currently have and will never have symptoms – from “pre-symptomatic” carriers – those who don’t have symptoms now, but will get them later. But the general public often uses the term “asymptomatic” to describe both categories of infected people.
Regardless of which term you use, researchers have found that about half of coronavirus transmissions happen between people who don’t have any symptoms. And in some cases, people are more contagious before they start showing symptoms.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
105,How effective are different types of face masks? Which cloth masks work the best?,"Different types have different levels of effectiveness, according to researchers at Florida Atlantic University. 
They compared four types of face masks commonly used by the public: a stitched mask with two layers of fabric, a commercial cone mask, a folded handkerchief, and a bandana. Researchers tested each to see which would likely offer the most protection if someone coughed or sneezed.
— The stitched mask with two layers of fabric performed the best, with droplets traveling only 2.5 inches. 
— With a cone-style mask, the droplets traveled about 8 inches. 
— A folded handkerchief performed worse, with droplets traveling 1 foot, 3 inches. 
— The bandana gave the least amount of protection of the cloth masks tested, with droplets traveling 3 feet. 
— Still, any kind of cloth mask is better than none, the researchers found. Without any covering, droplets were able to travel 8 feet. 
“People need to know that wearing masks can reduce transmission of the virus by as much as 50%, and those who refuse are putting their lives, their families, their friends, and their communities at risk,” said Dr. Christopher, director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
106,Are cancer patients at higher risk of severe complications from Covid-19?,"Yes. And the increased risk applies to cancer patients of all ages, the CDC says. 
“Having cancer currently increases your risk of severe illness from COVID-19,” the CDC says. “At this time, it is not known whether having a history of cancer increases your risk.”
Researchers found that patients whose cancer was getting worse or spreading were more than five times more likely to die in a month if they caught Covid-19.
But there are steps cancer patients can take to stay as healthy as possible: 

Make sure you have at least a 30-day supply of your medications.
Don’t delay any life-saving treatment or emergency care during this pandemic.
Talk with your healthcare provider about your individual level of risk based on your condition, your treatment, and the level of transmission in your community.
Don’t stop taking your medicines or alter your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider.
Call your healthcare provider if you think you may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus.

107,I tested positive for coronavirus weeks ago. How long are people contagious with Covid-19? Do I need to keep isolating or getting retested?,"For symptomatic carriers: If it’s been at least 10 days since your symptoms started and at least 24 hours since you’ve had a fever (without the help of fever-reducing medication) and your other symptoms have improved, you can go ahead and stop isolating, the CDC says.
Patients with severe illness may have to keep isolating for up to 20 days after symptoms started.
(But it’s important to note symptoms typically don’t show up until several days after infection — and you can be more contagious during this pre-symptomatic time. Also, symptoms can last for weeks or months — including in young people.) 
For asymptomatic carriers: People who tested positive but don’t have any symptoms can stop isolating 10 days after the first positive test – as long as they have not subsequently developed symptoms, the CDC says.
But 10 days is just a general guideline: “Because symptoms cannot be used to gauge where these individuals are in the course of their illness, it is possible that the duration of viral shedding could be longer or shorter than 10 days after their first positive test,” the CDC warned. With viral shedding, a person can infect others with the virus, even if they have no symptoms.
Asymptomatic carriers who have tested positive can also stop isolating if they get two negative test results from tests taken more than 24 hours apart. At that point, it’s very unlikely they are still contagious.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
108,Is it safe to go on vacation?,"It depends on how careful you are. 
While some parts of the country have more cases of Covid-19 than others, “I think even more important than where someone goes is what they do when they go there,” said Dr. Andrew Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. 
“Much like even when you’re at home, if you are essentially controlling your environment, not going out  into public places with large crowds, you’re wearing a face mask, you’re washing your hands, you can go on vacation safely,” he said. 
“I think certainly flying on planes is a little less safe than driving,” Thomas said. “But it’s really what you do when you go there. If you’re going to bars and restaurants, not wearing a mask, going out with large crowds … you’re going to potentially come home with the virus.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
109,Is it true that kids aren’t big spreaders of coronavirus? How much do children get Covid-19?,"“Kids can transmit the virus. They are susceptible to it,” said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA. “And the rates of hospitalization is going up.”
In Florida, for example, the number of children who had been hospitalized with Covid-19 surged 23% in eight days – from 246 on July 16 to 303 on July 24.
While children are far less likely to die from coronavirus than adults, more studies show kids can contract and spread coronavirus – contrary to claims made by President Donald Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos:
– A study out of South Korea shows children at least 10 years old can transmit Covid-19 within a household just as much as adults can.
– In the US, a CDC study showed more than half of the children ages 6 to 10 who attended Georgia summer camp in June and got tested for Covid-19 tested positive. 
The study – which examined test results following a camp that more than 600 campers 120 staffers attended – found that 51% of those ages 6 to 10 tested positive; 44% of those ages 11 to 17 tested positive; and 33% of those ages 18 to 21 tested positive.
“This investigation adds to the body of evidence demonstrating that children of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and, contrary to early reports, might play an important role in transmission,” wrote the CDC study’s authors.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"

One CDC study found 35% of survivors surveyed still had symptoms two to three weeks after their coronavirus tests: 

In the 18-to-34 age group, 26% said they still had symptoms weeks later. 
In the 35-to-49 age range, 32% were still grappling with the effects weeks later.

111,What “underlying conditions” put people at higher risk of bad outcomes with Covid-19?,"More than 40% of US adults have at least one underlying condition that can put them at higher risk of severe complications, according to the CDC. 
Those conditions include obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, according to the CDC. 
People who have cancer, an organ transplant, sickle cell anemia, poorly controlled HIV or any autoimmune disorder are also at higher risk.
Covid-19 patients with pre-existing conditions — regardless of their age — are 6 times more likely to hospitalized and 12 times more likely to die from the disease than those who had no pre-existing conditions, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.

113,Will the protests over police brutality increase the spread of Covid-19?,"Any large gathering can increase the spread because this coronavirus is transmissible by talking or even just breathing. Carriers of the virus can be contagious even if they don’t have symptoms. 
And when people are “shouting and cheering loudly, that does produce a lot of droplets and aerosolization that can spread the virus to people,” said Dr. James Phillips, a physician and assistant professor at George Washington University Hospital.
So doctors and officials say it’s extremely important to wear a face mask and try to keep your distance from others as much as possible.

But unlike the flu, Covid-19 can cause a loss of taste or smell.
And about half of coronavirus transmissions happen before any symptoms show up. (Many of those people spreading the virus silently are pre-symptomatic and are more contagious before they start showing symptoms.)
So the best way to know if you have the novel coronavirus or the flu (or both) is to get tested.

119,Can I have the flu and coronavirus at the same time?,"“You can certainly get both the flu and Covid-19 at the same time, which could be catastrophic to your immune system,” said Dr. Adrian Burrowes, a family medicine physician in Florida.
In fact, getting infected with one can make you more vulnerable to getting sick with the other, epidemiologist Dr. Seema Yasmin said. 
“Once you get infected with the flu and some other respiratory viruses, it weakens your body,” she said. “Your defenses go down, and it makes you vulnerable to getting a second infection on top of that.”
On their own, both Covid-19 and the flu can attack the lungs, potentially causing pneumonia, fluid in the lungs or respiratory failure, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
“The two (illnesses) together definitely could be more injurious to the lungs and cause more respiratory failure,” said Dr. Michael Matthay, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
And just like with Covid-19, even young, healthy people can die from the flu.
The good news is there are easy ways to help avoid a flu/Covid-19 double whammy: get a flu vaccine, stay 6 feet away from anyone outside your household, and wear a face mask anytime you might be in close contact with others.

What’s the difference between aerosols and droplets?,"Aerosolized spread is the potential for coronavirus to spread not just by respiratory droplets, but by even smaller particles called aerosols that can float in the air longer than droplets and can spread farther than 6 feet. 
Respiratory aerosols and droplets are released when someone talks, breaths, sings, sneezes or coughs. But the main difference is size. 
Respiratory droplets are bigger – between 5 and 10 microns in diameter. (For perspective, a human hair is typically 60 to 120 microns wide.) 
“If you have droplets that come out of a person, they generally go down within 6 feet,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
But aerosols (aka droplet nuclei) are smaller – less than 5 microns in diameter, according to the World Health Organization.
“Aerosol means the droplets don’t drop immediately,” Fauci said. “They hang around for a period of time.”
This becomes “very relevant” when you are indoors and there is poor ventilation, he said. 
“There’s good enough data to say that aerosol transmission [of coronavirus] does occur,” Fauci said
Multiple case studies suggest coronavirus can spread well beyond 6 feet through airborne transmission, such as during choir practices, said Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips, chief clinical officer of Providence Health System. 
In Washington state, for example,  53 members of a choir fell sick and two people died after one member attended rehearsals and later tested positive for Covid-19.  
In July, 239 scientists backed a letter urging public health agencies to recognize the potential for aerosolized spread.
“There is significant potential for inhalation exposure to viruses in microscopic respiratory droplets (microdroplets) at short to medium distances (up to several meters, or room scale), and we are advocating for the use of preventive measures to mitigate this route of airborne transmission,” the letter said.
Fauci said there’s an easy way to help minimize the risk: “Wear the mask.”

121,Why is it so difficult to make a drug to cure coronavirus?,"An antiviral drug must be able to target the specific part of a virus’ life cycle that is necessary for it to reproduce, according to Harvard Medical School.
“In addition, an antiviral drug must be able to kill a virus without killing the human cell it occupies. And viruses are highly adaptive.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
122,How long does immunity last if you recover from Covid-19? Are you immune for life?,"Research is still evolving, but a recent study examining antibodies suggests you could be immune for months after infection. 
“Although this cannot provide conclusive evidence that these antibody responses protect from reinfection, we believe it is very likely that they will decrease the odds ratio of reinfection,” researchers from Mount Sinai wrote.
“It is still unclear if infection with SARS-CoV-2 [the scientific name for the novel coronavirus] in humans protects from reinfection and for how long.”
There have been some reports of people getting infected twice within several months. Doctors said a 25-year-old Nevada man appeared to be the first documented case of Covid-19 reinfection in the US. He was first diagnosed in April, then recovered and tested negative twice, then tested positive again about a month later. 
A separate team of researchers said a 33-year-old man living in Hong Kong had Covid-19 twice, in March and August. 
And earlier this year, an 89-year-old Dutch woman – who also had a rare white blood cell cancer – died after catching Covid-19 twice, experts said. She became the first known person to die after getting reinfected.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
123,Is there a cure?,"“To date, there is no evidence that very high vitamin D levels are protective against COVID-19 and consequently medical guidance is that people should not be supplementing their vitamin D levels beyond those which are currently recommended by published medical advice,” wrote Robin May, director of the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham in the UK. 
Vitamin D is important for healthy muscles, strong bones and a powerful immune system. The recommended daily dose of vitamin D for anyone over age 1 is 15 mcg/600 IU per day in the US. For anyone over 70 years of age in the US, the recommended daily intake goes up to 20 mcg/800 IU per day.
But too much vitamin D can lead to a toxic buildup of calcium in your blood that can cause confusion, disorientation, heart rhythm problems, bone pain, kidney damage and painful kidney stones.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
124,Will Americans be required to get a Covid-19 vaccine? What happens if I don’t get vaccinated?,"Fauci said he does not foresee a Covid-19 vaccine mandate in the United States.
But if you don’t get a vaccine, the consequences will extend far beyond yourself. Not only will you be more vulnerable to getting Covid-19, but it could be harder to achieve herd immunity through vaccination. 
In other words: Getting a vaccine is important to help slow this pandemic down or grind it to a halt. And that will help the country get back to normal, faster.
If only half of all Americans are willing to get vaccinated, Covid-19 could stick around for years, said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
125,How long will we have to keep wearing masks?,"For at least several more months, but not forever. 
“It’s estimated that about 70% of Americans must be vaccinated before we get to herd immunity through vaccination. That’s the point where enough people have the immune protection that the virus won’t spread anymore,” said emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen, a visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.
“This means about 230 million Americans must receive the vaccine. It will take time to produce this many vaccines — and remember the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are two-dose vaccines, so you need double the number of doses as people,” Wen said. 
“Then the vaccine must be distributed and actually given to people. If all goes well, the best estimates are that it will be late spring or early summer for most Americans to receive the vaccine. At that point, we could probably see one another without masks — but not before.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
126,What’s the best way to prevent getting infected?,"Stay at least 6 feet away from others, wear a face mask when in public or when you’re close to people who don’t live with you, wash your hands often, and stop touching your face. Stay home as much as possible and limit your contact with people. 
The best way to kill germs is by scrubbing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Do this frequently before, during and after you visit a public place or have contact with people. 
When soap isn’t available, use a hand sanitizer. Rub the sanitizer around your hands until it’s dry.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
127,How much will a Covid-19 vaccine cost?,"The federal government has already purchased hundreds of millions of vaccine doses.
“Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost,” the CDC says. 
“However, vaccination providers can charge an administration fee for giving someone the shot. Vaccination providers can be reimbursed for this by the patient’s public or private insurance company or, for uninsured patients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund.” 
But no one can be denied a vaccine if they are unable to pay the vaccine administration fee, the CDC says.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
128,What are the side effects of the vaccines?,"Some vaccine trial volunteers have reported feeling flu-like effects after getting the shots. Don’t freak out if this happens to you, health experts say. 
“These are immune responses, so if you feel something after vaccination, you should expect to feel that,” said Patricia Stinchfield of Children’s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.
“And when you do, it’s normal that you have some arm soreness or some fatigue or some body aches or even some fever,” Stinchfield said. Some people may feel bad enough to need to stay home from work for a day, she said.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has shown no serious safety concerns, Pfizer said. Pfizer has said side effects “such as fever, fatigue and chills” have been “generally mild to moderate” and lasted one to two days.
Moderna said its vaccine did not have any serious side effects.

130,"If someone already had Covid-19, should they still get the vaccine?","“Yes. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19 and the fact that reinfection with COVID-19 is possible, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19 infection,” the CDC says.
“Experts do not yet know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.”
In some cases, a vaccine might give stronger protection than antibodies produced after being infected, epidemiologist Dr. Larry Brilliant said. 
“There are actually six other coronaviruses – MERS and SARS and four other viruses that create the common cold. They don’t seem to do very well at creating long-term immunity,” Brilliant said. 
“Many of the vaccines that we’ve made in history are actually stronger than the virus is itself at creating immunity.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
131,"If vaccines prevent people from getting *sick* with coronavirus, can they also prevent people from *carrying* the virus and infecting others?","“So far, we can’t say for sure,” CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. 
That’s because clinical trials have largely focused on whether vaccines protect recipients from getting sick with moderate to severe Covid-19. But there are hopeful signs that some vaccines might help prevent recipients from getting the virus at all and spreading it to others.
Moderna said its vaccine may be able to prevent infection and transmission.
“What Moderna did … is they took some extra samples, or test swabs, from the subject in the clinical trial between the first and second dose of vaccine. Remember, they give you two doses, and after four weeks they get that second dose of vaccine,” said Dr. Rick Bright, former head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. 
“They looked at these samples, and they found out that more people who received the placebo dose got infected from the coronavirus than the people who get the vaccine dose. That means the first dose of vaccine actually could be offering some level of protection against infection – not just protection from severe illness,” he said. 
“So if this plays out in a larger study, in a larger analysis, it could be very compelling to show that these vaccines could have impact over this protection of infection.”
A study from the UK suggests the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which has not yet been authorized for use in the US, might also help slow the spread of coronavirus. Researchers measured transmission by swabbing some participants for the virus every week. They found that the rate of positive tests declined by about half after two doses of the vaccine.
Both Bright and the FDA said it’s not yet clear whether the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine prevents people from infecting others. 
“Most vaccines that protect from viral illnesses also reduce transmission of the virus that causes the disease by those who are vaccinated,” the FDA said. “While it is hoped this will be the case, the scientific community does not yet know if the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will reduce such transmission.”",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
132,What can I do after I’m vaccinated?,"This answer is for people who have been fully vaccinated. That means at least two weeks have passed since your second dose of the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, or at least two weeks have passed since your single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. 
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says fully vaccinated people can:

Visit other vaccinated people indoors without masks or physical distancing
Visit indoors with unvaccinated people from a single household without masks or physical distancing, if the unvaccinated people are at low risk for severe disease
Skip quarantining and testing if you’re exposed to someone who has Covid-19 but are asymptomatic. (You should still monitor for symptoms for 14 days, though.)

But full vaccination doesn’t mean you can run wild and ditch all safety precautions. We’re still far away from herd immunity, so health experts say you still need to:

Wear a mask and keep good distance around those who are unvaccinated and at increased risk for severe Covid-19
Wear masks and physically distance when visiting unvaccinated people who are from multiple households
Keep physical distance in public
Avoid medium- and large-sized crowds
Avoid poorly ventilated public spaces
Wash your hands frequently

134,How long will immunity last after getting a Covid-19 vaccine?,"It’s still too early to tell, the US Food and Drug Administration says. 
The three vaccines currently used in the US were developed less than a year after Covid-19 was first detected in the US. The FDA said emergency authorization was swift, but it did not come at the cost of safety. 
But since all Covid-19 vaccines are relatively new, it’s not clear exactly how long immunity from the vaccines will last. 
“It may be that coronavirus vaccine becomes something that you have to get every year, like the flu vaccine,” emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen said. 
Others say it’s possible you could go much longer without needing another Covid-19 vaccine — especially if enough people get vaccinated right now. 
“The vaccine elicits such high levels of antibodies that even when confronted with a variant … there’s still meaningful protection,” said Dr. Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied mRNA vaccines like Pfizer’s and Moderna’s for years.
“These mRNA vaccines – it really seems the level of antibodies they elicit are so high, they are persistent … I would not be surprised if this is a vaccine that we only get once.”
Vaccine trial participants are still being closely monitored. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine remains more than 91% effective against symptomatic Covid-19 for at least six months, the companies said. They said the vaccine also appeared to be fully effective against the worrying B.1.351 variant of the virus, which researchers feared had evolved to evade the protection of vaccines.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"
135,How good are these vaccines?,"Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines give about 95% protection against symptomatic Covid-19, and both are virtually 100% effective against severe Covid-19 illness. In their clinical trials, no one who was vaccinated died from Covid-19.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 72% effective against Covid-19 among US trial participants and 85% effective against severe Covid-19. Like the other two vaccines, no one who was vaccinated during the clinical trial died from Covid-19.
But that doesn’t mean Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is worse than the Moderna or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Johnson & Johnson’s was tested later, when coronavirus cases were surging and new variant strains were spreading more widely. 
And unlike the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which require two doses, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one dose.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"

137,Is it true young people with coronavirus are also having blood clots and strokes?,"Yes, some young adults have suffered strokes after getting coronavirus. 
“The virus seems to be causing increased clotting in the large arteries, leading to severe stroke,” said Dr. Thomas Oxley, a neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai Health System in New York.

But we do know Covid-19 is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can spread via saliva, coughs, sneezes, talking or breathing — with or without symptoms of illness.
So three Harvard physicians examined the likelihood of getting or giving Covid-19 during sex and made several recommendations. 
For partners who haven’t been isolating together, they should wear masks and avoid kissing, the authors write.
In addition to wearing masks, people who have sex with partners outside of their home should also shower before and after; avoid sex acts that involve the oral transmission of bodily fluids; clean up the area afterward with soap or alcohol wipes to reduce their likelihood of infection.",https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/health/coronavirus-questions-answers/,en,"You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19 and vaccines"

140,Does WHO recommend routine wearing masks for healthy people during the 2019 nCoV outbreak?,"No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-nCoV
    transmission. Masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic persons in the community. Misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually need to wear them. In health care facilities where health care workers are directly taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients, masks are an important part of containing 2019-nCoV spread between people, along with other PPE and hand

This evidence demonstrates viral transmission by droplets and contact with contaminated
    surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy), thus

In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Blood centers should have routine blood donor screening measures in place to prevent individuals with respiratory symptoms or fever from donating blood.  As precautionary measures, blood centers might encourage self-deferral of those with travel history to an COVID-19 affected country in the previous 14 days, or of those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

If the latrine is not in the same room as the patient, place soiled excrement in covered bucket to dispose of in the toilet or latrine; Wash and disinfect linen: washing by machine with warm water (60-90°C) and laundry detergent is recommended for cleaning and disinfection of linens. If machine washing is not possible, linen can be soaked in hot water and soap in a large drum, using a stick to stir, avoiding splashing. If hot water not available, soak linen in 0.05% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes.  Finally, rinse with clean water and let linen dry fully in the sunlight.

In addition, there is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat.  Preparing chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05% with varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector.  Even if stored at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily.  In comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat or sunlight.  The antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface membrane of the COVID-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
153,Is there a model for setting up an isolation ward and types and products and health requirements?,A model for setting up an isolation ward is currently under development. PPE specifications for healthcare workers caring for nCoV patients can be found  in the disease commodity package at: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov),https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
154,Are there special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV?,"No, there are no special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV. Authorities and medical facilities should proceed with their existing policies and regulations that guide post-mortem management of persons who died from infectious diseases.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
155,Is there a special procedure regarding waste produced by patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV?,No. Waste produced during the health care or home care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should be disposed of as infectious waste.Click here for more information on disposing of infectious waste.Click here to visit the CDC website.,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
156,Can COVID-19 be passed through breastfeeding?,Transmission of active COVID-19 (virus that can cause infection) through breast milk and breastfeeding has not been detected to date. There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding.,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
157,"In communities where COVID-19 is prevalent, should mothers breastfeed?","Yes. In all socio-economic settings, breastfeeding improves survival and provides lifelong health and development advantages to newborns and infants. Breastfeeding also improves the health of mothers.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
158,"Following delivery, should a baby still be immediately placed skin-to-skin and breastfed if the mother is confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19?","Yes. Immediate and continued skin-to-skin care, including kangaroo mother care, improves the temperature control of newborns and is associated with improved survival among newborn babies. Placing the newborn close to the mother also enables early initiation of breastfeeding which also reduces mortality.The numerous benefits of skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with COVID-19.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
159,Can women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 breastfeed?,"Yes. Women with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should:Wash hands frequently with soap and water or use alcohol-based hand rub and especially before touching the baby;Wear a medical mask during any contact with the baby, including while feeding;Sneeze or cough into a tissue. Then dispose of it immediately and wash hands again;Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces that mothers have touched.It is important to replace medical masks as soon as they become damp and dispose of them immediately. Masks should not be reused or touched in the front.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
160,If a mother confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 does not have a medical face mask should she still breastfeed?,"Yes. Breastfeeding unquestionably reduces mortality in newborns and infants and provides numerous lifelong health and brain development advantages to the child. Mothers with symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to wear a medical mask, but even if this is not possible, breastfeeding should be continued. Mothers should follow other infection prevention measures, such as washing hands, cleaning surfaces, sneezing or
    coughing into a tissue.Non-medical masks (e.g. home-made or cloth masks) have not been evaluated. At this time, it is not possible to make a recommendation for or against their use.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
161,What is WHO doing to support malaria-affected countries in the context of COVID-19?,"The WHO Global Malaria Programme is leading a cross-partner effort to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus in malaria-affected countries and, where possible, contribute towards a successful COVID-19 response. The work is being carried out in close collaboration with colleagues based at WHO headquarters, regional offices and country level.In March 2020, before the pandemic had secured a strong footing in Africa, WHO sounded an urgent call for maintaining core malaria prevention and treatment services while protecting health workers and communities against COVID-19 transmission. The findings of a modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published in April, reinforced the WHO call for continuity of malaria services during then pandemic.In collaboration with partners, WHO developed technical guidance for countries on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment in COVID-19 settings. Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
162,I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and am too unwell to breastfeed my baby directly. What can I do?,"If you are too unwell to breastfeed your baby due to COVID-19 or other complications, you should be supported to safely provide your baby with breast milk in a way possible, available, and acceptable to you. This could include:Expressing milk;Donor human milk. If expressing breast milk or donor human milk are not feasible then consider wet nursing (another woman breastfeeds the child) or infant formula milk with measures to ensure that it is feasible, correctly prepared, safe and sustainable.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
163,"I have confirmed or suspected COVID-19, is it safer to give my baby infant formula milk?","No. There are always risks associated with giving infant formula milk to newborns and infants in all settings. The risks associated with giving infant formula milk are increased whenever home and community conditions are compromised, such as reduced access
to health services if a baby becomes unwell, reduced access to clean water and/or access to supplies of infant formula milk are difficult or not guaranteed, affordable and sustainable.
The numerous benefits of breastfeeding substantially outweigh the potential risks of transmission and illness associated with the COVID-19 virus.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
164,"I had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and was unable to breastfeed, when can I start to breastfeed again?",You can start to breastfeed when you feel well enough to do so. There is no fixed time interval to wait after confirmed or suspected COVID-19. There is no evidence that breastfeeding changes the clinical course of COVID-19 in a mother. Health workers or breastfeeding counsellors should support you to relactate.,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
165,How many malaria-affected countries have reported cases of COVID-19?,"Malaria-endemic countries in all WHO have regions have reported cases of COVID-19. In the WHO African Region, which carries more than 90% of the global malaria burden, 45 countries had reported approximately 25 000 cases of the disease
    as of 30 April 2020. The latest situation reports on the COVID-19 pandemic are available on the WHO website.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
166,Should core malaria vector control interventions be maintained in view of the rapid global spread of COVID-19?,"As of March 2020, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. WHO commends the leaders of Benin, Chad, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali, Niger, Sierra Leone and Uganda for committing to move forward with ITN campaigns during the pandemic. Other countries are adapting their net distribution strategies to ensure households receive the nets as quickly and safely as possible.Together with partners, WHO has developed guidance to ensure that those suffering from malaria can safely receive the care they need in COVID-19 settings.  Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response includes guidance on the prevention of infection through vector control and chemoprevention, testing, treatment of cases, clinical services, supply chain and laboratory activities. The document is consistent with broader WHO guidance on how to maintain essential health services during the pandemic.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
167,Are there any changes to WHO guidance with respect to malaria diagnosis and treatment?,"WHO guidance remains the same. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease.As signs and symptoms of malaria and COVID-19 can overlap (such as a fever), public health messages will need to be adapted in malaria-endemic settings so that people who have a fever are encouraged to seek immediate treatment rather than stay at home; without prompt treatment, a mild case of malaria can rapidly progress to severe illness and death.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
168,What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19?,"In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer possible.Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers and communities safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
169,What are the key considerations for countries that are working to eliminate malaria or prevent re-establishment of transmission?,"All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
170,Why is WHO particularly concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-affected areas?,"Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries.A new modelling analysis from WHO and partners, published on 23 April, found that the number of malaria deaths in sub-Saharan Africa could double this year alone if there are severe disruptions in access to insecticide-treated nets and antimalarial medicines due to COVID-19. These projections reinforce the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria during the pandemic.In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO and partners have developed guidance on how to safely maintain malaria prevention and treatment services in COVID-19 settings.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
171,Have there been disruptions in the global supply of key malaria-related commodities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. In recent weeks, there have been reports of disruptions in the supply chains of essential malaria commodities – such as long-lasting insecticidal nets, rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial medicines – resulting from lockdowns and from a suspension of the importation and exportation of goods in response to COVID-19. WHO and partners are working together to ensure the availability of key malaria control tools, particularly in countries with a high burden of the disease, and that efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 do not compromise access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
172,Should WHO-recommended preventive therapies be maintained in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Yes, delivery of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) should be maintained provided that best practices for protecting health workers – and other front-line workers – from COVID-19 are followed. Ensuring access to these and other core malaria prevention tools saves lives and is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems in the context of the COVID-19 response.Tailoring malaria interventions in the COVID-19 response, developed by WHO and partners, includes guidance on how to deliver preventive therapies for pregnant women and young children in ways that protect health workers and communities against potential COVID-19 transmission.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
173,Why should I care about violence against women during COVID-19?,"Violence against women is a grave violation of women’s human rights, no matter when, where, or how it takes place. There are many forms of violence against women, which have many potential negative health consequences for women and their children.  Violence against women can result in injuries and serious physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. In extreme cases, violence against women can result in death. The effects of violence are very often long-lived. Violence – in all its forms – can have an impact on a woman’s well-being throughout the rest of her life. This is unacceptable, and the risks of violence that women and their children face during the current COVID-19 crisis cannot be ignored. When we are able to prevent violence, or to support women survivors of violence, we help to safeguard women’s human rights, and promote physical and mental health and well-being for women throughout their lives. This also helps to alleviate pressure on already stretched essential public services, including the health system.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
174,Who is most vulnerable?,"Women who are displaced, who are migrants or refugees, and those living in conflict-affected areas, older women and women with disabilities are particularly at risk of violence and are likely to be disproportionately affected by violence during COVID-19.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
175,How does COVID-19 increase risks of violence for women?,"Stress, the disruption of social and protective networks, loss of income and decreased access to services all can exacerbate the risk of violence for women. In many countries, where people are encouraged or required to stay at home, the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase. Please see the following resource for more detail: https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/emergencies/COVID-19-VAW-full-text.pdf In addition, access to sexual and reproductive health services will likely become more limited. Other services, such as hotlines, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services, may also be reduced, making it difficult for women to access the few sources of help that would usually be available.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
176,Has violence against women increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Violence against women is highly prevalent, and intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence. During health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, violence against women tends to increase.  Whilst data are scarce, reports from across the world, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and other countries suggest a significant increase in domestic violence cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports from other countries suggest a reduction in survivors seeking services due to a combination of lockdown measures and not wanting to attend health services for fear of infection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
177,I am a policy maker. What can I do to prevent and address violence against women during COVID-19?,"When making preparedness and response plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, include essential services for violence against women. Allocate adequate resources for services for survivors and identify ways to make them accessible – particularly in the context of measures to restrict people’s movement. Explore the use of telemedicine, digital health, or mhealth to enhance access to support and services for survivors, while ensuring this is safe for them.  Explore alternative shelters for women who may require this. Ensure that lockdown measures do not penalize women for seeking support when experiencing violence, such as by going to the police or hospital to report violence.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
178,I run a health facility. What can I do to support women survivors of violence during COVID-19?,"Identify information on local services for survivors, including on hotlines, shelters, rape crisis centers, and counselling.  Find out opening hours, contact details and whether these services can be offered remotely, and establish referral linkages.  Make these available to health care providers and easily accessible to patients/clients coming to your facility.  Support the health care providers in your facility to continue to support women survivors of violence during this time. Be prepared to shift rapidly to providing care through alternative ways, by creating effective response plans; for example, by ensuring frontline healthcare workers have phones and can charge them.  Ensure there is a protocol in place to ensure continued safe document storage in case of sudden lockdown. Inform survivors of ways they can protect themselves, and provide small credit card-size cards listing relevant phone numbers for support",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
179,I am a health worker. How can I help women survivors of violence during COVID-19?,"As a health worker, there are things you can do to help mitigate the impacts of violence on women and children at any time, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Whilst your time and resources may be stretched during this health emergency, you have a duty of care to women who may seek help from you – often to address physical and mental hurt caused by violence.   You may need to adjust how you deliver services, if face-to-face care is not possible. Depending on your resources consider mobile phone, WhatsApp or other communication channels to deliver support, always ensuring you can do this in a way that is safe for the survivor. Communicate openly with women about any changes in service delivery.   If a woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 seeks your care because of violence, your response should be the same as for any other survivor. You should however ensure that you are protected from infection, by maintaining distance where possible, wearing protective clothing, practicing respiratory hygiene, and washing hands and surfaces with soap and water regularly and after touching, to avoid infection. In any circumstances, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers should provide first-line support, using the LIVES approach to help women survivors of violence:  Listen closely, with empathy and no judgement Inquire about women’s needs and concerns Validate women’s experiences. Show you believe and understand. Enhance their safety. Support women to connect with additional services.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
180,I have harmed or am worried about harming or hurting my partner (and children) with my words or actions. How can I stop?,"If you feel yourself getting angry or very annoyed, step away into another room if you can, or outside for a deep breath.  Count to ten and breathe in and out until you feel calmer. Count down from 10, or do anything else that may help you stay calm. Talk to a trusted friend, relative, or religious leader and if necessary seek help from local health services or specialized services if available.  Recognize that everyone in your family is experiencing stress during this time. Demonstrate kindness and patience in your words and actions.  Eliminate or reduce your alcohol consumption as much as possible. The current measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as restrictions on movement, as well as financial instability caused by the crisis, are likely to add to your stress.  This is normal, and you can control how you react.  Take measures to ensure you manage your stress in a way that is respectful and safe to you and your family. Try to be kind to yourself, your partner, children and anyone else in the family.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
181,I want to report an incidence of violence during COVID-19. What should I do?,"If you want to report an incidence of violence, you should follow your country’s guidance on how to report violence and contact the service where you are most likely to get a survivor-centred response.  Some countries are making exceptions to movement restrictions for reporting of violence specifically. Remember that reporting may put you at risk, so ensure you have a safety plan in place. You may find making a report mentally or emotionally difficult. Seek the support of friends, relations, neighbours or colleagues, or local support services for survivors of violence.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
182,I am worried about someone I know. How can I help?,"If you know of, or are concerned about, someone in an abusive relationship there are some things you can do: Keep regularly in touch with the person to check that they are safe, ensuring that it is safe for them to be in touch with you. Assume that a perpetrator of violence can see, hear and or monitor communications, so find out how best to communicate with the person that you are concerned about.  Send them an SMS or message via email or social media, in a way that is safe for them. Be discrete in connecting with them when the abuser is present in the home so that they are not placed at risk of additional harm. Check each time, as this may change. Find out what services for survivors of violence against women (e.g. shelters, hotlines, counselling services, women’s organizations) are functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic and make this information available through your networks and social media. Only provide this information directly if you can do so discretely without the abuser finding out.  If someone you know needs urgent help for whatever reason, be prepared to call emergency health services, the police, health centre, or hotline.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
183,"I am safe, but I am suffering from mental / sexual / social / long-term physical health problems because of violence. Is there anyone who can help me during COVID-19?","As much as possible, reduce sources of stress: Maintain contact with and seek support from family and friends via phone, email, text, etc. Try to maintain daily routines and make time for physical activity and sleep. Use relaxation exercises (e.g. slow breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, grounding exercises – see WHO Clinical handbook p.70) to relieve stressful thoughts and feelings. Engage in activities that in the past have helped with managing adversity. Seek information about COVID- 19 from reliable sources and reduce the time spent consuming news (for example, 1-2 times per day, rather than every hour). Seek care from a trained health provider for symptoms and conditions including injuries that need medical attention. Due to restrictions on movement, and pressure on health systems, it may be difficult to access healthcare in person at this time. In this case, find out what is available in your locality and seek alternatives, including information and support offered by phone or online.  If you are currently receiving healthcare and support for violence-related issues this could continue during COVID-19 – this could even be by phone or online if feasible and appropriate for your health needs.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

What can I do?,"If you are experiencing violence, it may be helpful to reach out to family, friends and neighbors, to seek support from a hotline or, if safe, from online service for survivors of violence. Find out if local services (e.g. shelters, counselling) are open and reach out to them if available. Make a safety plan in case the violence against you or your children escalates. This includes: Identifying a neighbour, friend, relative, colleague, or shelter to go to in case you need to leave the house immediately for safety. Have a plan for how you will exit the house safely and how you will reach there (e.g. transport).  Keep a few essential items (e.g. identification documents, phone, money, medicines, and clothes) available, and a list of telephone numbers in case of an emergency.  If possible, develop a code with a trusted neighbour so they can come to your aid in case of an emergency.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
186,How do I stay active in and around the home?,"Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting, whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes.
    Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing. For more ideas and illustrations of healthy stretches
    see here.Set up a regular routine to be active every day, by planning a physical activity or exercise break either by yourself, by joining an online class, or by setting up a time to be active online with your friends or colleagues. Making a specific
    time to be active helps ensure you get your daily physical activity. Put the time in your diary, and it will help remind you. Stick with it, as this will help you build a regular routine, and help you adjust to new ways of working, study and family
    life under COVID-19 restrictionsBe active with your family and friends, connecting with others can help you and your family in the home and elsewhere spend time together and be active. Planning time to be active with your children with
    active games at home, walks in the parks, or cycling can be a way the whole family can relax, be together and be active and healthy whilst at home.   Set yourself and your family Be Active goals, by choosing a specific type of activity, time of day and/or number of minutes you will do every day. Get each family member to choose their own goal which sets a bit of a challenge but is
    realistic with help from family or friends and motivation.

Learn a new skill – for example try an learn to juggle. Encourage doing some muscle strength training activities such as lifting weights or use improvised weight such as bottles full of water or sand.For Adults Climb up the stairs as much as you can, think of it as an opportunity to be active. Use household chores as a way to be more physical activity. Join in an online exercise class or make up your own routine to music you enjoy that uses the major muscle groups and raises you heart rate. Do some muscle strengthening activities such as lifting weights or improvise using full bottles of water or simply use your own body weight and do sets of press ups, sit ups and squats. Make time for fun, such as dancing to music.Where to get more help and informationFor more ideas use internet search platforms and check out social media for suggestions and access to free resources suitable for children of all ages and adults of all fitness and abilities.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
187,So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?,"Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
188,How much physical activity is recommended?,"WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. (available here for children under age of 5 and here for youth, adults and olders) Here are the minimum levels we recommend:Infants under the age of 1 year need to be physically active several times a day.
    Children under 5 years of age should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day.
    Children and adolescents aged 5-17yearsall children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week.Adults aged over 18 years should do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per
        week.
    older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.
      But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time. Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spent
    sitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

Physical activity includes all forms of active
recreation, sports participation, cycling and walking, as well as activities
you do at work and around the home and garden. It doesn’t have to be exercise
or sport – play, dance, gardening, and even house cleaning and carrying heavy
shopping is all part of being physically active.During the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many of us are
very restricted in our movements, it is even more important for people of all
ages and abilities to be as active as possible. Even a short break from
sitting, by doing 3-5 minutes of physical movement, such as walking or
stretching, will help ease muscle strain, relieve mental tension and improve
blood circulation and muscle activity. Regular physical activity can also help
to give the day a routine and be a way of staying in contact with family and
friends.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
190,Should pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV with COVID-19 and their newborns be managed differently?,"There is currently no known difference between the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 or risk of severe illness or foetal compromise for pregnant and non-pregnant women or adults of reproductive age.  Pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Data are limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19. There are no reported deaths in pregnant women at time of publishing this information[17] however, COVID-19 testing of symptomatic pregnant women may need to be prioritized to enable access to specialized care.  All recently pregnant women with COVID-19 or who have recovered from COVID-19 should be provided with information and counselling on safe infant feeding and appropriate IPC measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission[18].With confirmed disease or under investigation, management is similar to non-pregnant women, with appropriate isolation of confirmed or under investigation.  Obstetric facilities must be notified and prepared, noting that each infant born to any mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered a ‘person under investigation’ and should be isolated according to the IPC guidance.  Currently, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
191,Can pregnant or postpartum women living with HIV transmit the COVID-19 virus to their unborn child or infant?,"There are few data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in specific populations, such as children and pregnant women[13] but findings from a small published study suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy[14].  Although no vertical transmission has been documented, transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern. Infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 should be fed according to standard infant feeding guidelines[15], while applying necessary precautions for infection prevention and control (IPC).  As with all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, symptomatic mothers who are breastfeeding or practicing skin-to-skin contact or kangaroo mother care should practice respiratory hygiene, including during feeding (for example, use of a medical mask when near a child if the mother has respiratory symptoms), perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the child, and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces with which the symptomatic mother has been in contact[16].   Q&A on COVID-19, pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
192,How do we ensure human rights and reduce stigma and discrimination?,"As the world scales up public health responses to the COVID19 pandemic, countries are being urged to take decisive action to control the epidemic. WHO has urged all countries to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.  WHO is working with partners including the UNAIDS Joint Programme and the Global Network of People Living with HIV to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure HIV-related services continue without disruption.To mitigate potential prison outbreaks of COVID19 and reduce morbidity and mortality among people in prisons and other closed settings, it is crucial that prisons and immigration detention centres are embedded within the broader public health response. This requires close collaboration between health and justice ministries and includes protocols for entry screening, personal protection measures, physical distancing, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and restriction of movement, including limitation of transfers and access for non-essential staff and visitors.  In the current context it is of critical importance that countries work toward developing non-custodial strategies to prevent overcrowding in closed settings[10]. Governance of prison health by a ministry of health, rather than a ministry of justice or similar, is likely to facilitate this[11].",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
193,I am a policy maker. What can I do to make sure people can access contraception and family planning information and services?,"Plan and develop innovative strategies to ensure as many eligible people as possible can access information and contraception during this period. 


Increase use of mobile phones and digital technologies to help people make decisions about which contraceptive methods to use, and how they can be accessed.  


Enable health care workers to provide contraceptive information and services as per national guidelines to the full extent possible.  This is particularly important where pregnancy poses a high risk to health.   


Expand availability of contraceptive services (including both information and methods) through places other than healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, drug shops, online platforms and other outlets.  This can be with or without prescription depending on national guidelines and contraceptive method.   


Relax restrictions on the number of repeat issues of prescription-only hormonal contraceptives that can be issued. 


Ensure access to emergency post-coital contraception, including consideration of over the counter provision. 


Enable access to contraception for women and girls in the immediate post-partum and post abortion periods when they may access health services.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
194,How long the 2019-nCoV can survive on a dry surface?,"There is currently no data available on stability of 2019-nCoV on surfaces.  Data from laboratory studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown that stability in the environment depends on several factors including relative temperature, humidity, and surface type. WHO continues to monitor existing evidence around nCoV and will update when such evidence is available.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
195,Where can I find more advice on assessing and managing health risks around international mass gatherings?,"WHO has produced guidance and also a training course on how to plan for a mass gathering. The guidance and the course both look at how to conduct a risk assessment, plan for and manage health risks in partnership with the local authorities: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings  You can find advice to give individual participants on how to protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
196,"If we go ahead with an international mass gathering, what can we do to reduce the risk of participants catching COVID-19?","Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility. You should consider whether the number of participants at the event could be reduced, making available participation by video or teleconference and possibly screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, malaise) at points of entry to the venue. You can find advice on how individual participants can protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
197,What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020. See: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
198,Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
199,How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?,"High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
200,Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In hospitals physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
201,What if my organization does not have the expertise to assess the risks COVID-19 poses for our planned mass gathering?,The national and local public health authorities in the country where you plan to hold the mass gathering will most likely know how to conduct a health risk assessment. If there is a WHO Country Office there they may also be able to provide some expert support. So too might the WHO Regional Office in your part of the world. You can find the names and contact details of the WHO Regional Offices at https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/regional-offices,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
202,I want to avoid getting pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. What can I do?,"If you do not want to become pregnant, you should start or continue to use your contraceptive method of choice. You may be able to access information and contraceptive services from a healthcare provider by phone or online.  If you cannot access these services you may opt for a method that is available without a prescription (such as condoms, spermicides, pills, or emergency contraceptive pills) from a nearby pharmacy or drug shop.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
203,I want to change my contraceptive method – is this possible?,"Yes. It may be difficult however, to access all the methods of contraception that are normally available in your country due to restrictions on movement, lack of supply, as well as increased demands on health providers and services.  


If you have a pre-existing health condition, consult a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. Seek advice and information from your health provider and consider using methods that do not have medical restrictions like minipills, condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, diaphragm, spermicides or lactational amenorrhea if you are exclusively breastfeeding.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
204,Is contraception/ family planning safe to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. All modern methods of contraception are safe to use, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  


If you have had a baby in the last six months or have a health condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or breast cancer – or if you smoke – seek advice from a health care professional to ensure you are using a method of contraception which is suitable and safe for you.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
205,Does traveling to campgrounds or going camping pose any risks?,"Yes. Going camping at a time when much of the United States is experiencing community spread of COVID-19 can pose a risk to you if you come in close contact with others or share public facilities (like restrooms or picnic areas) at campsites or along the trails. Exposure may be especially unsafe if you are more likely to get very ill from COVID-19 and are planning to be in remote areas, without easy access to medical care. Also be aware that many local, state, and national public parks have been temporarily closed due to COVID-19.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html,en,Travel: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers  | CDC
206,What is the best contraceptive method to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"All modern methods of contraception help to prevent pregnancy. Women and their partners can choose any modern contraceptive method that is acceptable to and safe for them. The best method of contraception is the one that works well for you.
There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best. For more information see here. 
Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.  They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent up to 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse, and they can be taken by anyone with or without a health condition",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,"World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

207,What can I expect when departing other countries?,"Some countries are conducting exit screening for all passengers leaving their country. Before being permitted to board a departing flight, you may have your temperature taken and be asked questions about your travel history and health.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html,en,Travel: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers  | CDC
208,I can’t access my contraceptive method of choice. What do you advise?,"If you cannot access your contraceptive method of choice – perhaps because it requires a prescription, or because it can only be given to you by a health worker – consider using condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, lactational amenorrhea (if you are exclusively breastfeeding), or other contraceptive methods that are recommended for self-care in your country.  


Depending on the situation in your country, methods recommended for self-care could include the pill or mini-pill, emergency contraception pills, and DMPA-SC (Sayana Press®).",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,"World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
"
209,What are the risks arising from public transport to the venue(s)?,The extra risk from participants and spectators travelling on public transport in a major city may not be significant compared to the ongoing risk to the local population using the transport all the time if physical distancing is not possible on public transport.,https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
210,Are there additional safeguards event organizers can implement or recommend to athletes/officials/visitors in the context of COVID-19?,"Follow standard preventative advice to the general public, including physical distancing, in the athletes’ village.Also promote:signage, digital messaging to all participants and their entourages about COVID-19 and how to prevent infectionregular disinfection and cleaning of surfaces, in venues and in personal spaces non-sharing of equipment and cleaning of equipment after each user.Organizers are recommended to develop a checklist (include hand gels stations, hygiene facilities, etc.). See the event mitigation recommendations checklist for event organizers above.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
211,Should event organizers arrange screening at venues beyond national government requirements for point of entry (PoE)?,"Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers’ contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers. Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity.Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups – athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
212,"Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.  Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV).  In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

214,Should I delay going on a cruise?,"Yes. CDC recommends that all travelers defer all cruise ship travel worldwide. Recent reports of COVID-19 on cruise ships highlight the risk of infection to cruise ship passengers and crew.

215,Should event organizers provide COVID-19 testing?,"No, testing should be conducted in accordance with local health providers and national guidance.  Anyone unwell or symptomatic should not be allowed to participate in the event. Establish close collaboration with local public health authorities well before the event, to facilitate testing for athletes, officials or spectators who meet pre-agreed suspect cases definitions. Consider host-country health service capacity to manage any COVID-19 activity, and other public health issues happening at the event over and above its own national pandemic response.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
216,What happens if there is a sick passenger on an international or domestic flight?,"Under current federal regulations, pilots must report all illnesses and deaths to CDC before arriving to a U.S. destination. According to CDC disease protocols, if a sick traveler is considered a risk to the public’s health, CDC works with local and state health departments and international public health agencies to contact exposed passengers and crew.
Be sure to give the airline your current contact information when booking your ticket so you can be notified if you are exposed to a sick traveler on a flight.

217,Can flying on an airplane increase my risk of getting COVID-19?,"Yes. Air travel requires spending time in security lines and airport terminals, which can bring you in close contact with other people and frequently touched surfaces. Most viruses and other germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes. However, social distancing is difficult on crowded flights, and you may have to sit near others (within 6 feet), sometimes for hours. This may increase your risk for exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19.",https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/faqs.html,en,Travel: Frequently Asked Questions and Answers  | CDC

219,I want to remove or replace my implant or IUD – can I do this during COVID-19 pandemic?,"Removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs, after the recommended period of use (and routine follow up appointments) may not be prioritized by your country’s health system during this health emergency. Seek advice from your health provider. If you are experiencing side effects or desire urgent removal for other reasons, contact a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. If, due to restrictions on movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic you cannot have your long acting method removed straight away, it is important to use another method of contraception to avoid pregnancy at this time.   There are no medical problems caused by delaying removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs. Do not try to remove the contraception method yourself; wait until you are able to access health care from a trained provider.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
220,What should be the criteria for excluding an athlete or other accredited participant from competing?,"Agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. These should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19, current symptomatology, etc. Athletes who are feeling unwell should not participate in events.If testing of athletes has been agreed with the local public health service there is a need to consider test availability, time taken for receipt of test results and host-country health services capacity. Criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.Requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:–   health check: travel declaration and temperature screening–   contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present) –   allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)–   following all hygiene precautions.  Isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
221,What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response?,"WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including the more than 80 studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. To date, 3 large randomized controlled trials, including the WHO Solidarity trial, have failed to show that the use of hydroxychloroquine among hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19 can prevent death or disease progression. Additionally, 3 trials of patients with mild or moderate disease failed to show a significant benefit in prevention of respiratory failure through the use of hydroxychloroquine. Thus, there is now growing evidence that hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for COVID-19. This evidence will inform the next update of WHO guidance on therapeutics. Studies on the use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to prevent individuals, particularly those at high risk such as health care workers, from contracting COVID-19 are ongoing. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to assess the protective efficacy of either of these medicines for the prevention of COVID-19 infection or disease. WHO cautions physicians against administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 outside the context of a clinical trial. Individuals are also advised against self-medicating with these drugs.For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO “R&D Blueprint” for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
222,What is WHO’s position on the use of Artemisia plant material for the prevention or treatment of malaria and/or COVID-19?,"The most widely used antimalarial treatments, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), are produced using the pure artemisinin compound extracted from the plant Artemisia annua. There have been reports that products or extracts (e.g. herbal teas or tablets) made from Artemisia plant material may have a preventive or curative effect on COVID-19. However, available in vitro data suggests that purified artemisinin compounds or A. annua plant product or extracts do not have an appreciable effect against COVID-19 at concentrations that could be safely achieved in humans. As such, current evidence does not support the use of artemisinins or A. annua products or extracts as an antiviral for COVID-19. WHO urges extreme caution over reports touting the efficacy of such products. As explained in a WHO position statement, there is no scientific evidence base to support the use of non-pharmaceutical forms of Artemisia for the prevention or treatment of malaria. There is also no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 can be prevented or treated with products made from Artemisia-based plant material.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
223,Does WHO recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves to prevent transmission of COVID-19?,"No, WHO does not recommend the use of masks with exhalation valves. These masks are intended for industrial workers to prevent dust and particles from being breathed in as the valve closes on inhale. However, the valve opens on exhale making it easier to breathe but also allowing any virus to funnel through the valve opening, making the mask ineffective at preventing the spread of COVID-19.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
224,"How should I put on, wear and take off a medical mask?","How to put on and take off a medical mask:

Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.  
Inspect the mask for tears or holes; do not use a mask that has previously been worn or is damaged. 
Verify which side is the top – this is usually where the metal strip is. 
Then, identify the inside of the mask, which is usually the white side. 
Place the mask on your face covering your nose, mouth and chin, making sure that there are no gaps between your face and the mask. Place the straps behind the head or ears.
Pinch the metal strip so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
Remember, do not touch the front of the mask while using it to avoid contamination; if you accidentally touch it, clean your hands.  

How to take off a medical mask:

Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.

225,How should I wear and care for a fabric mask?,"How to put on and wear a fabric mask:

Before touching the mask, clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. 
Inspect the mask for tears or holes, do not use a mask that is damaged. 
Adjust the mask to cover your mouth, nose, and chin, leaving no gaps on the sides. Place the straps behind the head or ears.
Avoid touching the mask while wearing it. If you accidentally touch it, clean your hands. 
Change your mask if it gets dirty or wet.

How to take off and store a fabric mask: 

Clean your hands before taking off the mask.
Take off the mask by removing it from the ear loops, without touching the front of the mask.
If your fabric mask is not dirty or wet and you plan to reuse it, put it in a clean plastic, resealable bag. If you need to use it again, hold the mask at the elastic loops when removing it from the bag. Clean your mask once a day.
Clean your hands after removing the mask. 

How to clean a fabric mask:

Wash fabric masks in soap or detergent and preferably hot water (at least 60 degrees Centigrade/140 degrees Fahrenheit) at least once a day.
If it is not possible to wash the masks in hot water, then: 

Wash the mask in soap/detergent and room temperature water, followed by either boiling the mask for 1 minute, OR; 
Soak the mask in 0.1% chlorine for 1 minute and thoroughly rinsing the mask with room temperature water (there should not be any toxic residue of chlorine on the mask).


General tips:

Make sure you have your own masks and do not share it with others.
Resist the temptation to pull down your mask or take if off when speaking to other people.
Do not store your mask around your arm or wrist or pull it down to rest around your chin or neck. Instead store it in a clean plastic bag.

227,"I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test should I take?","Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests detect antibodies produced in response to an infection. In
    most people, antibodies start to develop after days to weeks and can indicate if a person has had recent (IgM type antibodies) or past infection (IgG type). Antibody tests cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection or disease.
    They also cannot alone confirm immunity or duration of protection from reinfection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
228,What about rapid tests?,"Rapid tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test – RDT) detect viral proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although

239,Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) who are not taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) and have a low CD4 cell count, particularly those with advanced HIV disease, are at increased risk of opportunistic infections and AIDS related complications. However, there
    is evolving and conflicting evidence whether people living with HIV have an increased risk of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection and and/or COVID-19 clinical complications in PLHIV compared to the general population. PLHIV can have a greater prevalence of the known risk factors for COVID-19 acquisition and complications, such as heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, obesity, as well as, other comorbidities and co-infections, like tuberculosis. Several case report series and small cohort studies among hospitalized PLHIV with COVID-19 have shown comparable clinical outcomes and similar risk of SARS CoV2 infection when compared with general population, particularly in those with well controlled HIV infection (on ART and with a CD4 count > 200 cells/mm3 and supressed viral load). These limited clinical data suggest the mortality risk in PLHIV is associated with known COVID-19 factors such as older age and presence of comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and obesity [1-3].There have been several systematic and non-systematic reviews that evaluated COVID-19 outcomes among PLHIV; most have found comparable outcomes of mortality and morbidity when compared with HIV negative patients [4-8]. Methods did not always include assessment of outcomes while controlling for known COVID-19 risk factors [4]. There is also limited data in patients with advanced HIV disease (i.e. low CD4 cell count).  One systematic review, notably published as a pre-print, found of 144,795 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in North America, Europe, and Asia the pooled prevalence of HIV in COVID-19 patients was 1.22% [95% (CI): 0.61%-2.43%)] translating to a 2-fold increase compared to the respective local-level pooled HIV prevalence in the general population of 0.65% (95% CI: 0.48%-0.89%) – which hinted at a potential susceptibility among PLHIV [9].  Additional data on this topic come from several cohort studies from South Africa, the USA and the UK [10-12] have reported a moderate increased risk of death directly attributed to HIV infection after adjustments for age, sex, ethnicity and presence of
    comorbidities; an unpublished meta-analysis including these studies found that the risk of death was almost double that of HIV-negative patients; however, confounding by comorbidities associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 cannot be ruled
    out [13]. Protecting people living with HIV during the COVID-19 pandemic, and ensuring they can maintain treatment, is critical. Researchers are currently investigating whether people with HIV have an increased risk of poor outcomes with COVID-19.Preliminary
        evidence of moderate increased vulnerability of people with HIV makes it even more urgent that people with HIV have access to ARVs and treatments for co-morbidities – such as treatment for hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary
        disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, and maintenance of a healthy body weight.  A larger dataset from a broader geographical representation is required to expand understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 co-infection with HIV impacts the severity of illness, disease progression and outcomes from hospitalization with COVID-19. For this purpose, WHO has established a Global COVID-19 Clinical Platform. As of 4 November 2020, WHO has received clinical data from 79 000 patients hospitalised with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including from 5 291 hospitalised patients living with HIV, from over 30 countries around the world. The platform is open to all Member States and health facilities to contribute data and inclusion will help inform future guidance on how best to ensure PLHIV are well protected during the COVID-19 pandemic.PLHIV are advised to take the same COVID-19 precautions as recommended for the general population [14-15]: wash hands often; practice cough etiquette; ensure physical distancing; wear masks when appropriate and according to local regulations; seek medical care if symptomatic; self-isolate if one develops symptoms or has contact with a positive  COVID-19 case; and other actions per the local and government response.  It is important to ensure that PLHIV have access to antiretroviral drugs for longer periods (3-6 month supply); and that programmes practice multi-month dispensing (MMD) of ARVs, as well as, other necessary medications, such as, opiate substitution therapy (OST), TB preventative therapy (TPT) and treatments for comorbidities. It is also important to ensure that some vaccinations are up to date (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines) and there is access to adequate supplies of medicines to treat or prevent co-infections and comorbidities.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
240,When should health workers wear masks in the context of COVID-19?,"Health workers are the most likely to be exposed to COVID-19 because they are in close contact with patients with suspected, probable or confirmed COVID-19.In areas of community or cluster transmission, health workers, caregivers and visitors should wear a mask at all times when in the health facility, even if physical distancing can be maintained. Masks should be worn throughout their shifts, apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons:Health workers and caregivers include: doctors, nurses, midwives, medical attendants, cleaners, community health workers, and any others working in clinical areas.Health workers must remember to combine hand hygiene with any time they touch their mask or face, before and after putting on and removing their masks, as well as before they touch them to readjust them. In areas with sporadic spread of COVID-19, health workers in clinical areas should wear medical masks throughout their shift apart from when eating, drinking or needing to change the mask for specific reasons. Health workers should continue to physically distance and avoid unnecessary close contact with colleagues and others in the facility when not providing patient care. Respirator masks are recommended for use where aerosol generating procedures are in place for a suspect/confirmed COVID-19 patient. In these settings, WHO recommends the use of airborne and contact precautions.As health workers have been  infected with COVID-19 outside of health facilities, it is critical that health workers, as all people, follow the guidance to protect themselves from infection when outside of a health facility.Further resources:Healthcare workers can complete our OpenWHO course on how to put on and remove personal protective equipment.Read our guidance on ‘Infection prevention and control during health care when coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is suspected or confirmed’.WHO first issued interim guidance on recommended practices for health workers caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in January 2020, which included following droplet/contact precautions: surgical gown, gloves, medical mask, and eye protection.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
241,Why should people wear masks?,"Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more. Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
242,When should masks be worn by the general public?,"In areas where the virus is circulating, masks should be worn when you’re in crowded settings, where you can’t be at least 1 metre from others, and in rooms with poor or unknown ventilation. It’s not always easy to determine the quality of ventilation, which depends on the rate of air change, recirculation and outdoor fresh air. So if you have any doubts, it’s safer to simply wear a mask. You should always clean your hands before and after using a mask, and before touching it while wearing it. While wearing a mask, you should still keep physical distance from others as much as possible. Wearing a mask does not mean you can have close contact with people. For indoor public settings such as busy shopping centres, religious buildings, restaurants, schools and public transport, you should wear a mask if you cannot maintain physical distance from others. If a visitor comes to your home who is not a member of the household, wear a mask if you cannot maintain a physical distance or the ventilation is poor. When outside, wear a mask if you cannot maintain physical distance from others. Some examples are busy markets, crowded streets and bus stops.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
243,"How do I choose what fabric mask to buy, or ideal fit and fabrics if I make my own?","Check for filtration, breathability and fit when choosing a fabric mask. It should be held in place comfortably with little adjustment using elastic bands or ties. There are different mask shapes such as flat-fold or duckbill – find the one that fits closely over your nose, cheeks and chin. When the edges of the mask are not close to the face and shift, such as when speaking, air penetrates through the edges of the mask rather than being filtered through the fabric. Masks with vents or exhalation valves are not advised because they allow unfiltered breath to escape the mask.Fabric masks should be made of three layers of fabric:Inner layer of absorbent material, such as cotton.Middle layer of non-woven non-absorbent material, such as polypropylene.Outer layer of non-absorbent material, such as polyester or polyester blend.If purchasing a fabric mask from a store, check to make sure it meets national performance standards.

244,"What is the difference between medical masks and respirators, like N95s?","Medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are:composed of 3 layers of synthetic nonwoven materialsconfigured to have filtration layers sandwiched in the middleavailable in different thicknesseshave various levels of fluid-resistance and filtrationRespirators (also known as filtering facepiece respirators – FFP) are available at different performance levels such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99.Medical masks and respirator masks are similar in their protection value. However, respirators are specific for certain procedures and instances because they have a tightly fitted component to them. Respirator masks are designed to protect healthcare workers who provide care to COVID-19 patients in settings and areas where aerosol generating procedures are undertaken. Healthcare workers should be fit tested before using a respirator to ensure that they are wearing the correct size. Wearing a loose-fitting respirator will not offer the same protection to the wearer and may allow small particles to get inside the mask through the sides.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
245,Does WHO recommend the use of gloves in the community to prevent transmission of COVID-19?,"No, WHO does not advise using gloves by people in the community. Instead, WHO encourages the installation of public hand hygiene stations at the entrance and exit of public places, such as supermarkets or public/private buildings. This helps reduce germs brought in by people’s hands. By widely improving hand hygiene practices, countries can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus and other infections.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
246,Can antiretrovirals or direct-acting antivirals against hepatitis C virus be used to treat COVID-19?,"Antiretrovirals drugs were initially considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19 based on virtual screening and in vitro studies. Published data indicate that most of patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms, have good clinical outcomes and do not require hospitalization. In some cases, patients admitted to the hospital were given an antiretroviral drug, most often lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r) or, less frequently, darunavir boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r). Studies assessing the potential benefit of an antiretroviral drug on COVID-19 were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals. A systematic review on use of antiretrovirals in patients with coronaviruses, conducted in March 2020 identified two randomized trials and 21 observational studies provided clinical outcome data on the use of LPV/r for the treatment of COVID‐19, SARS and MERS [16]. The randomized trials showed no clinical benefit, the observational studies were inconclusive, and the certainty of the body of evidence across all important outcomes was low or very low quality. A living systematic review and network meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of drug treatments for COVID-19 published in September 2020 did not find any convincing evidence that antiretrovirals drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir reduced the mortality or increased the rate of viral clearance [17].More recently, two additional randomized studies confirmed these findings and didn't support the use of LPV/r for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.A recently published clinical trial showed that in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, LPV/r was not associated with reductions in mortality, duration of hospital stay, or risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death [18].  Similarly, in the WHO-coordinated Solidarity Trial recently published, LPV/r appears to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19 patients, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. [19].Based on available evidence, the use of LPV/r and other antiretrovirals are not likely to improve clinical outcomes in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19.Several randomized and nonrandomized studies have evaluated anti-hepatitis C drugs including sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for treating of SARS-CoV-2 and while these preliminary results suggested benefit in terms of clinical recovery, this evidence is insufficient (small sample size, inclusion of a nonrandomized study) to be able to recommend using these antivirals for treating SARS-CoV-2. [20]",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
247,Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection?,"A number of small studies have assessed whether antiretrovirals can be used to prevent infection from SARS-CoV2, often with discordant results. A recent study suggests that people living with HIV who were using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2. However, other studies indicate that tenofovir-based HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) does not provide protection against infection with the new coronavirus, nor does it ameliorate the course of COVID-19 disease [21]. In this study, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was actually higher among people taking PrEP compared to individuals who were not.Taken together, the available literature does not provide conclusive evidence that antiretrovirals could protect individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection or from becoming seriously ill with the virus. However, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure.People taking PrEP or who are taking ARVs with the hopes of preventing COVID-19 need to adopt the same COVID-19 prevention measures as recommended for people in the general population.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
248,What is WHO’s position on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of COVID-19?,"WHO does not currently recommend the use of antiretrovirals as treatment or prevention of COVID-19, outside of the context of clinical trials. Existing published literature on antiretrovirals is mostly observational in nature, with few clinical trials; and does not provide good quality evidence in favour of these agents for these purposes. The current body of evidence does not show benefit of using LPV/r and other antiretrovirals reduce the risk of new coronavirus infection or improve clinical outcomes in symptomatic disease among patients with COVID‐19. More recently, two additional randomized studies confirmed these findings and didn't support the use of LPV/r for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Recovery trial showed that LPV/r was not associated with reduction in mortality, time of hospitalisation stay and risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death. [18] The interim results of the WHO multicounty adaptative trial (Solidarity trial) also found that LPV/r had little or no effect on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [19].",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
249,How can programmes assure continued access to HIV services?,"Continuous access to essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services must be assured, including in settings where measurements of confinement are implemented within the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted and evidence-based
    measures to reduce possible transmission should be considered and implemented. These include [24]:Applying standard precautions for all patients (including ensuring that all patients cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, offering a medical mask to patients with suspected COVID-19 infection while they are
        in waiting in the service, perform hand hygiene etc.)Health care and outreach workers, as well as peer educators and clients should apply hand hygiene and other protective measuresEnsuring triage, early recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected COVID-19 infection)Ensure there is adequate ventilation in all areas in the healthcare facilitySpatial distance between 1 and 2 meters should ideally be maintained between all patients within all types of servicesCleaning and disinfection procedures should be followed consistently and correctlyDispensing medicines (for treatment of HIV, TB and other chronic conditions such as opioid dependence) for longer periods allowing reduced frequency of patient visitsConsider reduction of services to the most critical ones (provision of essential treatment and prevention services; services such as counselling sessions may be reduced or adapted)Many countries have developed virtual ways of delivering services and supporting people to reduce clinic attendance. Countries have also increased self-care options, for example HIV self-testing, often in combination with virtual support to keep services going.   There are many examples of innovations being used to support the continuation of PrEP services including virtual support, community and home distribution and using HIVST for monitoring during periods when clinic services have been suspended. 
        Learning from these may help guide future implementation in the post-COVID-9 era.   Generally, vulnerable populations, including members of key populations (men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who use drugs, transgender people and people in prisons) as well as homeless and/or displaced people may be at increased risk of infection – because of additional comorbidities impacting on their immune system, reduced ability to apply measures of confinement and social distancing, as well as generally limited access to health services. It is critical that services that reach these populations such as community-based services, drop-in centres and outreach services can continue providing life-saving HIV prevention (distribution of condoms, PrEP, needles and syringes), testing and treatment while securing safety of staff and clients. Services can be adapted according to above considerations where applicable.  Some prevention services, such as voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), which require clinic attendance, were initially suspended in the early phases of the response to the COVID-19 epidemic. Some countries, following assessing the covid situation, have adjusted their responses and are restating VMMC services with additional COVID-19 prevention measures.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
250,What is the role multi-month prescriptions and dispensing for antiretrovirals and other medicines?,"All PLHIV doing well on ART can benefit from simplified antiretroviral therapy delivery models which include multi-month prescriptions and dispensing (3-6 month supply) which will reduce the frequency of visits to clinical settings and ensures continuity of treatment during possible disruption of movements during the coronavirus outbreak.  Similar consideration should be given to providing people who are clinically stable on methadone or buprenorphine substitution therapy with an increased possibility for take-home medications to reduce additional burden on the health sector. Many countries have now implemented the provision of take-home dosages for stable patients on opioid substitution therapy as recommended by WHO [25].As is common practice, experienced preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) users may be given multi-month prescriptions according to national guidance which may include regular STI testing. Individuals initiating PrEP should continue to return for a 1-month follow-up HIV testing and clinic visit before receiving multi-month prescriptions. This is to rule out acute HIV infection, assess adverse effects and determine intention to continue PrEP use. However, flexibility for the 1-month visit can be considered for motivated clients who have not had a recent (in the past 3 weeks) potential exposure to HIV. These decisions could be made on a case-by-case basis between providers and clients initiating PrEP for the first time. Telehealth and community dispensing can be considered for follow up. Quality-assured HIV self-testing can be considered for maintenance.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
251,What is WHO’s position on use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19?,The current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 infection is suspected advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason.[8]This guidance is based on several systematic reviews that cite lack of effectiveness and possible harm from routine treatment with corticosteroids for viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.[9],https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
252,"What is the difference between self-isolation, self-quarantine and distancing?","Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19.Quarantine is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility or at home for 14 days. Isolation is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus. Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you should remain in isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test positive.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
253,Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?,"Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms. WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how long they persist, and why they occur.  These studies will be used to develop further guidance for patient care.",https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,en,World Health Organization: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)

312,Could air conditioning systems help spread the virus?,"Air conditioning and ventilation are actually considered effective control strategies for reducing infection risks to the public in indoor spaces, according to a framework that occupational health professionals use called “the hierarchy of controls.” Air conditioning and ventilation are actually considered effective control strategies for reducing infection risks to the public in indoor spaces, according to a framework that occupational health professionals use called “the hierarchy of controls.” If a ventilation system is well maintained, the risk of transmission should not be significant. By well maintained, we mean that the system is inspected periodically, the filters are changed according to manufacturer recommendations, the duct systems are cleaned periodically, and the most efficient filters available are used (for example, MERV [minimum efficiency reporting  value] filters with a rating of 13 to 16 for homes; HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters for hospitals). Keep in mind, that even in well-ventilated environments, people should continue following recommendations of physical distancing, face covering, and frequent hand hygiene. At present, there is no strong evidence to suggest that a well-maintained air conditioning, ventilation, or other type of climate control system will contribute to the transmission of COVID-19.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
313,Do we know if the virus can enter through the eye?,"There is no evidence yet that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can gain entrance through the eye. However, there are now reports of the virus being present in tears and on the surface of the eye. While most of those patients were very ill, it is likely that the surface of the eye and its tears may contain virus and it’s best to avoid touching the eye or tears of any potential patient. There is no evidence yet that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can gain entrance through the eye. However, there are now reports of the virus being present in tears and on the surface of the eye. While most of those patients were very ill, it is likely that the surface of the eye and its tears may contain virus and it’s best to avoid touching the eye or tears of any potential patient. While we do not yet have any direct evidence that the virus is infectious if it touches the eye, we must assume that it is a possibility. As the general precautions all stress, anyone who touches someone who may be infected (or something they may have touched) should wash their hands immediately, and refrain from touching their own face (which would include the mouth and nose—known sites of infection—as well as the eyes).",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
314,What determines whether a virus disappears or becomes endemic?,"Two main clues help us predict whether a virus is going to stick around. First, we consider the virus’s origins. If it came from animals and could still be circulating in animals, then no matter how good we are at getting rid of it in humans, animals could always bring it back. That’s true with influenza: Even if a certain strain disappears, a new one might emerge from animals—as we’ve seen with avian viruses.

That’s true with influenza: Even if a certain strain disappears, a new one might emerge from animals—as we’ve seen with avian viruses. But with a major outbreak like COVID-19 already underway in humans, the big question is how good humans are at developing immunity. And, if they gain immunity, does it stick, or does it fizzle out over time—leaving the door open a crack for the virus to return? As the first cases get further and further out from the point of infection, that data will give us a better idea of what to expect.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
315,"Does an overreaction by the immune system play a role in COVID-19 deaths, or are they caused strictly by damage inflicted by the virus itself?","Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with respiratory tissue damage that can impair lung function and even cause death. Though it is likely that both the virus and immune system contribute to this process, it can be difficult to determine which mechanism causes the most damage. To establish infection, a virus must enter a host cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell’s machinery to replicate, eventually killing the cell and releasing more virus. This process not only damages host tissues, but also potently activates the immune system. The immune system in turn unleashes powerful weapons to control the infection. However, if not carefully regulated, the immune response itself can cause collateral damage to host tissues and exacerbate disease severity. More research on the host and viral factors that contribute to severe COVID-19 disease and death could provide important clues for clinicians and researchers in the search for new treatments.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

317,Can the new coronavirus be transmitted via paper money?,"Cash can be contaminated with potential bacterial pathogens, but there is little information about viruses on cash in general—and nothing about contamination with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Cash can be contaminated with potential bacterial pathogens, but there is little information about viruses on cash in general—and nothing about contamination with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is spread by person-to-person contact—not normally by touching fomites (objects that may be contaminated with, and help transmit, infectious organisms) like cash. And, it’s unclear how long COVID-19 remains viable on surfaces—ranging from a few minutes to hours to potentially days depending on the temperature, humidity and surface type. Switching from cash to plastic has not been proven more protective, either, except perhaps by reducing person-to person hand exposure. Some countries are washing or disinfecting cash, but there is no data demonstrating how this process works. The best practice is social distancing: limiting person-to-person contact by shutting down schools, bars, and other crowded places. That is what will slow infections, prevent health care systems from overloading, and reduce deaths. That is why everyone should do their part and embrace social distancing rather than worrying about using money or credit cards.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
318,What’s a reproductive number and what does it tell us about an outbreak’s future?,"The reproductive number represents the average number of people that one infected person will infect. The reproductive number for a disease can change based on how infectious the pathogen is, the host population, and environmental factors. The reproductive number represents the average number of people that one infected person will infect. The reproductive number for a disease can change based on how infectious the pathogen is, the host population, and environmental factors. To control an outbreak, the goal is to reduce a disease’s reproductive number to less than 1. If the reproductive number remains 1 or higher, the outbreak will continue. In the case of COVID-19, the estimated reproductive number is around 2.6, meaning the outbreak is expected to continue. The reproductive number can be reduced by altering transmission dynamics—with social distancing, home isolation, quarantine, and use of personal protective equipment in health care settings. Over time as people are infected and recover—or if a vaccine becomes available (which may take months or years)—immunity in the population also reduces the effective reproductive number of a disease.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

Risk communications, however, is a key aspect in shaping the course of an epidemic, and how prepared people are to combat it. When you think of containing an epidemic, from Ebola to coronavirus, labs and disease surveillance are often top of mind. Risk communications, however, is a key aspect in shaping the course of an epidemic, and how prepared people are to combat it. People need timely, accurate and easy-to-understand information that encourages protective behavior without inciting panic.

320,What are some of the major challenges to global cooperation in this coronavirus outbreak?,"Data transparency and political sensitivity are two of the most critical challenges to effective global cooperation on the COVID-19 outbreak—and they are deeply entwined. Data transparency and political sensitivity are two of the most critical challenges to effective global cooperation on the COVID-19 outbreak—and they are deeply entwined. China has a history of concealing, delaying or refusing to share data and information (this happened with SARS in 2002-2003 and in 2018, when China reportedly refused to share samples of a bird flu with pandemic potential). Leading global health agencies have praised China’s response to COVID-19, while other experts doubt the accuracy of the reported data. Data transparency is key to building much-needed trust—and preventing the misallocation of resources, which could slow the response. Some countries in Asia—where China holds significant economic and political influence—have carefully crafted their public coronavirus responses, aware that criticizing China could hinder cooperation. And all stakeholders face a difficult task: balancing effective disease response with the political sensitivity necessary for a successful, cooperative, global response.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
321,"As COVID-19 symptoms mimic those of common cold and flu viruses, how do you know when you should seek testing or special care?","The symptoms of COVID-19—including fever, cough, and difficulty breathing—are similar to those of other cold and flu viruses. At this moment, the decision to test for COVID-19 in the US depends on both the patient’s clinical status and what is happening in a particular geographic location. A history of travel, especially international travel to one of the most affected areas, is still important, but this is evolving as the outbreak develops domestically. Close contact with someone who traveled to those areas or with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19 are other considerations.
The evaluation of cold and flu symptoms will often include testing for routine respiratory viruses as well, especially influenza. In general, if you do not have symptoms and would not ordinarily seek medical care based on how you feel now, you do not need evaluation or testing for COVID-19.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
322,What are the special risks of COVID-19 to pregnant women?,"Infection rate and progression to severe disease in pregnant women is similar to that in nonpregnant adult women. The same protective measures against transmission of the virus apply to both.
 
So far, no transmission from mother to fetus has been described. Vaginal delivery should be encouraged when both the mother and the baby are not severely sick. Strict protective measures (facemasks, hand hygiene) must be observed to protect the newborn and the personnel during and after childbirth.
 
Separation of the mother and baby and breastfeeding should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with the mother. The newborn should be protected from infection by the mother as much as possible. If the mother wishes to express her milk or breastfeed, disinfection of the breast should be added to the protection methods mentioned above.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
323,Do health care workers present a risk to the community by returning home after work?,"Health care workers are always very aware of the risks they face at work while caring for patients.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increased vigilance in health care settings to prevent infection of patients and health care workers.  Hospital infection control programs are charged with protecting our health care workforce and the patient populations we serve every single day. For protection against COVID infection, meticulous attention to hand hygiene, routine face masking and social distancing also apply in the health care setting.  In addition, health care workers are trained in the proper use and disposal of personal protective equipment and potentially contaminated materials, instructed not to come to work when sick, and if sick, are prioritized for COVID-19 testing.

324,Why will it likely take longer to develop a vaccine than a drug for COVID-19?,"The development of vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 share common goals: to ensure safety and efficacy. These are often assessed through a series of studies, sometimes beginning with animal experiments, progressing through human phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials with increasing numbers of participants. However, it often takes much longer to develop and rigorously assess a vaccine. First, vaccines are usually targeted to healthy people, in contrast to drugs administered to people with disease. Larger and longer studies are often needed to ensure the safety of vaccines. Second, the outcomes of interest often take much longer to be measured. Vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity can take many months to measure accurately, whereas whether or not a treated patient improves can take days. And some vaccines require multiple doses spread out over months whereas drug treatment regimens typically are days to weeks. Once developed, it can also take longer to manufacture and deploy vaccines.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

Public health departments would use that money to ensure expertise in emergency and pandemic planning. That’s key not only for the public health preparedness, but for preparedness in hospitals and long-term care facilities as well. The money could also be used for supplies.

328,Does the COVID-19 pandemic automatically mean setbacks for ongoing global health programs?,"Consider the limitations or strain already on health systems in many of the countries where global health programs operate. Whether related to health services, surveillance, or supply chains, meeting public demand can be an ongoing challenge at baseline. To add an outbreak response in those settings could spur an outright collapse of essential resources. And that could have a ripple effect for people in need of care across a range of issues, not only those exposed to a novel disease.

Consider a woman who can no longer visit a local clinic to protect her from pregnancy complications. Or the person living with HIV, TB, or some other chronic condition who can no longer receive lifesaving medications, either because of a breakdown or diversion of the pipeline intended to provide those. Furthermore, these very populations are at greater risk of poor outcomes from a disease like COVID-19, creating a potentially vicious cycle. That is why it's essential that policymakers and practitioners shore up resources that protect progress in other critical areas of global health, while preventing fallout from a new public health enemy.

Rather than using the term super spreaders (a person who infects a large number of people), we should think of them as super spreading events. Maybe a person is at the right time of infection and at the mall. Typhoid Mary infected many people because she was a cook. Part of the reason we stopped SARS is that a lot of super spreading was happening in health care settings and when people really got their act together in terms of infection control and biocontainment, it nipped the epidemic in the bud. Super spreading events have the largest influence an outbreak’s trajectory early on. If there’s only a few cases and one person then infects 10 others, it can make it start strong. Once an epidemic gets going and has 100 to 200 cases or more, the “law of large numbers” takes over—and it stops mattering so much.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

As the epidemic expands, cases may originate in any number of countries. We may already have unrecognized cases in the US. Travel bans can actually make us less safe. They can make countries facing restrictions not want to share information about their outbreaks. They can disrupt the distribution of supplies needed to control the epidemic. Similarly, as we saw with the US’s Ebola response in 2014, quarantining returning travelers makes doctors and nurses less likely to volunteer to serve in affected countries. This virus is likely past the point of containment.

335,Are strong national health systems all we need for pandemic preparedness?,"Strong health systems are certainly a crucial foundation for preparedness. All countries, rich or poor, need to have a set of core national preparedness capabilities.

For example, they need strong surveillance systems in place that can detect infectious diseases with pandemic potential, robust case detection, and effective contact tracing (i.e., identifying and reaching those who may have been in contact with an infected person). But that’s only part of the story. By definition, pandemics cross national boundaries—they are global in nature and they require a global response, not just a national one. A whole set of “transnational” activities, called global public goods, is another critical plank in pandemic preparedness. These require collective funding by countries. Such goods include developing medical countermeasures like pandemic vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments, stockpiling of medical supplies (including personal protective equipment), and ensuring that there is global “surge capacity” to rapidly scale up production and distribution of vaccines.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

Health care workers are often the first affected by these types of outbreaks and to some extent can act as a canary in the coalmine for how infectious a new disease outbreak is.  In the past, health care workers have died from infections and also amplified initial cases spreading the outbreak quickly.  If we are to protect health workers and limit transmission, we must do more to ensure the right training and the right equipment are available all the time and not just once an outbreak has started.

The goal in implementing public health measures during suspected outbreaks is to balance the freedom of individuals against the restrictions on freedom required to achieve legitimate protections of the public's health, with public and transparent justification of policy decisions. Whatever restrictions are implemented should be the least restrictive to accomplish the stated public health goals. Quarantine is considered a measure of last resort given the severe restrictions it imposes on individual liberty, and when misused or ineffective can severely undermine trust in government.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
338,"In the absence of approved treatments, what can health care providers do?","Even without approved treatments, there are several key ways health care providers can care for people with COVID-19 and keep them alive:
1.  Control their symptoms: Give them medications that make having COVID-19 more tolerable—ones that control fever, cough, and other commonly associated symptoms.
2.  Provide intensive support to the body of a sick person as their immune system battles the infection: We see that some patients may become critically ill with this disease, hence they may need mechanical ventilation or urgent dialysis. There may be a role for technologies such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to help their lungs recover from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
3.  Treat other infections that COVID-19 patients may get, such as concurrent bacterial pneumonia because their lungs are not functioning as well as they can.

340,Could export goods transmit SARS-CoV-2 infection around the world?,"The likelihood of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) through export goods originating from China or elsewhere is quite low. Although SARS-CoV-2 can survive on surfaces from 2 hours to 9 days, it is vulnerable to heat, changes in pH, and common disinfectants.  Since SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus (meaning it has a fragile outer layer), it is less stable and more susceptible to disinfectants. Therefore, the risk of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low—and so is the risk of catching the disease from a package that has been transported and exposed to different conditions (and temperatures).
So, feel free to order that dress from China or those leather shoes from Italy. While you are at it, wash your hands and maybe wipe the surface with a disinfectant because informed preventive measures are what we need to stop both COVID-19 and the fear epidemic from spreading.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

But clearly not all people become sick even in the worst pandemics. Epidemiologists typically mean an infectious disease epidemic that has spread or is spreading globally. Usually we refer to a pandemic only when it involves a new disease. So, for example, we talk about an influenza pandemic when there is a new strain of flu spreading around the world. In contrast, we do not refer to the global outbreak of seasonal influenza as a pandemic because the strains are not new.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 will likely continue with minimal variation. It will probably stay stable because very few people are immune—so many “naïve” human hosts are still available for maintaining current transmission cycles. This virus appears very balanced in terms of transmission-to-virulence. It also can be transmitted early in infection. Serious disease usually doesn’t occur until much later—and by that time, many patients are confined to a hospital bed. Consequently, a long transmission window is present before a person falls seriously ill, giving the virus plenty of time to spread. Selection is heavily driven by transmissibility, and the role of virulence in this process is much less clear.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

344,How does a virus shift from zoonotic to human-to-human transmission?,"When a virus passes from a nonhuman animal into a human, we call that moment of spillover a zoonotic transmission. It’s an ecological event. What happens next depends on evolutionary potential and chance. If the virus is adaptable, it may succeed in replicating and proliferating in the new human host. Maybe it kills the person and the line of transmission comes to an end there—as happens with rabies. But if the virus is even more adaptable, it may acquire the ability to pass from one human host to another, perhaps by sexual contact (as with HIV), perhaps in bodily fluids such as blood (as with Ebola), perhaps in respiratory droplets launched by coughing or sneezing (as with influenza or SARS). What makes a virus adaptable? The changeability of its genome, plus Darwinian natural selection. Those viruses with single-stranded RNA genomes, which replicate themselves inaccurately and therefore have highly changeable genomes, are among the most adaptable. Coronaviruses belong to that group.

COVID-19 doesn’t pose any known risk to blood donors during the donation process or from attending blood drives. Blood donation is a highly regulated, safe process—and most centers have implemented additional precautions including increased sanitation of donor areas, use of PPE, and social distancing to enhance their already-healthy environments. Additionally, since donors must be healthy on donation day, risk of exposure to sick individuals is extremely low. While donors may worry that they could be infected but asymptomatic, respiratory viruses are not generally thought to be transmitted by blood transfusion. There are no reported cases to date of transfusion transmission of COVID-19. Even during a shelter-in-place, people still require critical medical care. They will continue to be in car crashes, need emergency organ transplants and chemotherapy, and give birth to babies in critical condition.

That window can vary from a couple of weeks to a few months, depending on how much your immune system was triggered. We’ve now got a good population of people who have recovered from the virus. Serum samples from those patients can allow us to time exactly when they begin to develop antibodies and when they develop sufficient titers and neutralizing antibodies. This will help us determine what the window is for protection. Before your immune system returns to normal, you can be infected by not just this virus, but by regular colds and flu.

Cryptic transmission is the term that is used when there is no direct contact between person 1 shedding the virus and person 2 contracting it. It is an important indicator of community prevalence of a virus. There is essentially enough circulating virus in a community to transmit the same strain of the virus between individuals who are not directly linked. In the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, this term came into the lexicon after University of Washington researchers sequenced the COVID-19 genome from Snohomish County, Washington, which showed a direct genetic link from the first 2 cases in Washington though they had no known contact. This indicated there was significant community spread, and likely evidence the virus had been circulating for weeks by that point. As I noted on Twitter, the key takeaway is this is going to be a critical path for viral transmission given the potential infectivity prior to the manifestation of symptoms—and what will ultimately make it so hard to control the spread of the virus.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

In the case of n-coronavirus, the vaccine challenges are 2-fold. First, you have to interfere with the virus’s ability to dock with a specific receptor in the lungs called ACE2. Then, you need to reduce the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement. ADE means that some respiratory virus vaccines can actually make things worse. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. One option is creating a vaccine that only uses parts of the pathogen to stimulate the immune system. One approach is to do this by producing recombinant protein subunit vaccines. We have found that these vaccines that use a part of a protein of the virus (the spike protein) and known as the receptor binding domain (RBD) are optimal for 2 reasons: Recombinant proteins are a standard technology that has resulted in other licensed vaccines, including the hepatitis B and HPV vaccines; and it’s possible to produce this vaccine in abundance and at low cost.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

352,Why are wild animals believed to be the source of this outbreak?,"About 60% of newly emerged and re-emerging pathogens share a common origin: the bodies of animals. Genetic and epidemiological evidence suggest that the novel coronavirus, like SARS, may have emerged from a so-called “wet market,” where wild species that would rarely encounter each other in nature are crammed together, allowing microbes to spread between species and into humans. China claimed to have cracked down on these markets after the SARS outbreak, but when I visited a few years later, it wasn’t hard to find one. 
But such markets are only part of the problem. The loss of wildlife habitat around the world more generally is forcing wild species to cram into closer proximity to human settlements. Bats, for example, have been fingered as the source of Ebola, SARS, and a host of other pathogens. When we cut down the forests where they live, they come roost in our backyards and farms instead. It’s this kind of novel, intimate contact that provides opportunities for the microbes that live in their bodies to spread into ours.

The CDC believes it is likely that COVID-19 will cause a pandemic, but there are steps that the public can take to protect and prepare themselves. First, it is important to stay informed and follow instructions issued by your local or state health department and the CDC. Basic infection control measures still apply in this scenario. Practicing good handwashing techniques or using hand sanitizer, avoiding people who are ill, and staying home when you are sick are all effective measures. A pandemic could interrupt supply chains and result in closures at local businesses, meaning it may be prudent to stock reserves of critical supplies. Examples include extra prescription medications, asthma relief inhalers, over-the-counter anti-fever and pain medications, non-perishable food items, household cleaning supplies, and toiletries.

Mortality rates will vary by country according to several factors. First, it will depend on the age structure of the population; Italy has the second oldest population in the world, which  may partly explain the high mortality observed. Health care availability (in terms of the number of hospital and intensive care beds) and accessibility (free versus paid) will also influence mortality. For example, low death rates in Germany and South Korea are partially attributed to the relatively high number of hospital beds per capita. Moreover, disparities in death rates between Hubei province—the location of Wuhan, where the outbreak first emerged—and other parts of China are thought to be due to the rapid case rise and resulting strain on health care resources in Hubei. Lastly, a country’s testing policy will be an important determining factor. If there is widespread testing of community as well as hospital-based cases, mortality will be lower than if testing was solely focused on hospital cases.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW

We’ll eventually have a vaccine, but that may be in 18 months or 5 years from now.
 
I think there will be waves of the epidemic across the US. What’s happening now in Seattle and New York, and to a lesser extent in San Francisco, will happen in Baltimore and Dallas at different times. Each wave will last a couple of months—from valley to peak to valley. As we begin to relax social distancing efforts—which we will have to do because society can’t stay like this—the disease will start to come back.

358,"With a given number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in a community, is there a way to estimate the number of actual cases?","Not reliably because the number of tests affects the number of confirmed cases: If you do more tests, you’ll find more cases.
 
A better—but still flawed—approach would be to use the number of COVID-19 deaths and back-calculate the number of infected cases. So, if there are 500 COVID deaths in a community and you assume a mortality rate of 1%, then that would indicate that there would be at least 50,000 cases. Why? Because 500 is 1% of 50,000. But this has problems, too. It doesn’t include recent infections; the number of COVID deaths may be under-reported; and it depends on the death rate. These points suggest 50,000 cases is likely an underestimate.
 
So, what do we do? We need good public health surveillance. We need to take representative samples of the community and test them. That’s the best way to get reliable estimates.

One small study of 34 Chinese men diagnosed with COVID-19 found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in their semen or testes ~1 month later. Another study—which didn’t address the sexual transmission question—found the virus in 6 of 38 patient semen samples. But that study involved much sicker men; the viral load by that stage could be a factor. And, severely ill people aren’t likely having sex; that’s a bigger question during recovery. Studies on patients with SARS-CoV-2 in their semen, testing weekly to see if and when it clears, could inform guidelines on how long post-diagnosis men should refrain from sex.

Early in the outbreak, there were concerns that Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) may increase the risk of COVID-19 illness, but medical organizations have concluded that they pose no increased risk—and have proven lifesaving benefits.
 
However, for patients who require a ventilator, it may be necessary to adjust or stop certain cardiac medications based on blood pressure and heart status.
 
Symptoms for COVID-19 and an active cardiac issue—such as shortness of breath and chest discomfort—can be similar. If heart medications are not being taken consistently to control cardiac symptoms, it is more difficult to distinguish between COVID-19 and a cardiac event. 
 
While some patients are understandably apprehensive about seeking care during the pandemic, it is crucial to not delay.

Some circumstances require long-term intake of immunosuppressing drugs, [such as with] organ transplantation and abrupt withdrawal poses a risk to patients to have organ failure due to rejection.

However, the concern is understandable given the high-profile Ebola outbreaks in recent years. Victims of that virus—and of other especially virulent diseases such as Marburg virus, Lassa fever, and cholera— are known to be highly infectious and extreme caution is necessary when burying victims.
 
For example, during the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, it was necessary to resort to cremation to protect the public from infectious bodies.
 
This is not necessary with COVID-19 victims. With certain precautions, it is safe to proceed with the usual burial practices based on religious and cultural traditions, while maintaining social distancing. The necessary PPE includes N95 masks, gloves, foot coverings, hair covers, eye covers—and standard hygiene practices such as frequent hand washing.
 
It remains important to give victims dignified burials, and families should be protected and respected throughout the burial process.

Contact tracers must have the ability to talk to, read, and connect to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 with empathy. A lot of this work is being done by phone, presenting extra challenges. Contact tracers need to be good at getting people to open up, while being as thorough as possible to determine potential exposures.
 
Mistrust is another challenge, especially with certain populations such as homeless people, those with mental health issues, and undocumented people—who have shown an increased reluctance to access public services recently. Contact tracers must be able to put them at ease and reassure them their names will not be used. 
 
In many cities, contact tracers who speak foreign languages are in high demand, too.

When you have hundreds of sequences of viruses from different animal species, you can actually line up the sequences and see how viruses relate to one another. You can make a “tree” showing those relationships—which viruses evolved from others—and how they have evolved naturally.

372,How does contact tracing vary in different countries and cultures?,"The fundamentals of contact tracing—investigating, finding, supporting, and isolating cases—do not vary by country, but the methods differ.
 
In many low- and middle-income countries, so-called “shoe-leather epidemiologists” conduct contact tracing, traveling door-to-door to ask direct questions (wearing out their shoes in the process).
 
In China and South Korea, smartphone surveillance has been key to contact tracing efforts. In the West, where individual rights and privacy are paramount, contact tracing is a harder sell. But it is a critical public health tool.
 
In the US, ethical contact tracing means carefully balancing individual rights with public health considerations. Interventions that may compromise individual freedoms—such as contact tracing or mandatory vaccines—must meet a 3-pronged legal standard demonstrating:
 
1.     Utmost respect for individuals’ independence
2.     Benefits to society that outweigh the “costs” of impinging on individual privacy
3.     All members of society benefit—not just an individual group

373,"What is intersectional analysis, and how could it mitigate health inequities in a pandemic?","Intersectional analysis rejects one-dimensional approaches to examining forms of oppression. Instead, it considers how characteristics such as gender, race, class, ability, and sexuality interconnect to form complex axes of discrimination and privilege. These identities impact an individual’s risk of ill health and access to appropriate treatment, and it is critical that global health policy is responsive to this.

The need to apply an intersectional lens is even more acute in a pandemic response. In such crises, social and economic inequalities exacerbate existing inequities in access to health, including those relating to housing, occupation, care responsibilities, and citizenship status. By collecting and analysing data on how COVID-19 affects groups of people differently, global health actors can take measures to prevent (often already marginalized) groups from being left further behind.

It enables countries to adapt their response for different populations with varying degrees of vulnerability to improve health outcomes.
 
The first step is recognizing that populations in a country, city, and even neighborhood are not homogeneously affected. The next step involves examining the factors that differentiate these health outcomes through an intersectional analysis framework. A preliminary method is to further disaggregate data by multiple social stratifiers to get a clear picture of who is most vulnerable. 
 
Politicians should be made aware of the inequitable pandemic outcomes, implement more effective evidence-informed policies, and give the decision-making power to public health experts—including diverse advisers who are aware of populations’ vulnerabilities. Lastly, they should adopt an explicit intersectional framework in their evaluation and adaptation of the pandemic response.

Face shields are also more comfortable to wear and easier to wear correctly, unlike many masks that people are prone to wear with their nose protruding. While recommendations diverge, I, and some others, prefer face shields because of their eye protection and ease of wearing.

There are 2 categories of COVID-19 tests: diagnostic tests to see if you currently have the disease, and antibody tests to find out if you were infected previously. The most important are diagnostic tests, because if you have the disease you need to take steps to avoid spreading it to others. Antibody tests are in high demand, because many people think that if they already had COVID-19, they won’t get it again, and they can stop physical distancing—but that’s unsafe because we don’t know yet if reinfection is possible. Antibody tests can also give false positive results, so people might think they had it and aren’t at risk of catching it again—and they’d be wrong.

377,Will COVID-19 make the coming flu season worse?,"Potentially, Yes. For a number of reasons.

We are already seeing a rise of COVID-19 cases over the past month that are straining health systems. Once flu season rolls around this will add additional strain to those systems.

We could also see a lot more flu/COVID-19 coinfection than we think because the tests commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 have a high false-negative rate, and their reliability can vary based on the type of sample taken: swab, sputum, or saliva.

That sample can determine whether the virus is detected or missed. Case studies have shown that some in some instances, only samples of lower respiratory sputum produced a positive result.

With flu/COVID-19 coinfection, it’s unknown whether one virus is making patients sicker than the other, if they’re competing with each other, or if they’re acting in conjunction to make patients even sicker.

The best way to minimize the chance of coinfection: get a flu shot and wear a face covering. Potentially, Yes. For a number of reasons.

We are already seeing a rise of COVID-19 cases over the past month that are straining health systems. Once flu season rolls around this will add additional strain to those systems.

We could also see a lot more flu/COVID-19 coinfection than we think because the tests commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 have a high false-negative rate, and their reliability can vary based on the type of sample taken: swab, sputum, or saliva.

That sample can determine whether the virus is detected or missed. Case studies have shown that some in some instances, only samples of lower respiratory sputum produced a positive result.

378,Will a COVID-19 vaccine be as unreliable as the seasonal flu vaccine?,"COVID-19 and seasonal flu present similar symptoms, but they differ when it comes to vaccines. COVID-19 and seasonal flu present similar symptoms, but they differ when it comes to vaccines. Because the influenza virus evolves very rapidly, seasonal flu vaccines efficacy rates have varied (10–60% in recent years). But so far, SARS-CoV-2 has not mutated in a way that changes our reaction to the virus. If a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine arrives before we see a major mutation, low vaccine efficacy shouldn’t be a major issue as it is with the flu. However, the concern with a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 is that historically seasonal coronaviruses do not trigger a strong, long-lasting immune response. So, as with the flu vaccine, we may end up needing a COVID-19 vaccine every year—but for different reasons. People get the flu vaccine every year because the virus changes. When it arrives, we may have to get a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine annually because the immunity doesn’t last.",https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-02/coronavirus-expert-reality-check,en,COVID-19 Expert Reality Check | Global Health NOW
379,Should I get tested if I don’t have symptoms?,"Your decision about whether to get tested will depend on personal factors: whether you have recently been around someone who is infected, rates of transmission in your area, whether you or someone you live with is high-risk, or whether you plan to visit someone not previously in your “bubble.”
 
It also depends on availability of testing in your area. If testing turnaround times are slow, the results may be moot by the time you get them.
 
Ideally, people without symptoms would have easy access to inexpensive rapid tests—similar to over-the-counter pregnancy tests.
 
These less-sensitive tests may miss lower levels of infection, but they’re pretty good at picking up infection when virus levels are at their highest, which is considered the most infectious period. This approach could help spot cases that would be missed by PCR testing—such as people who were discouraged from getting tested or couldn’t get an appointment.

Involvement in the crisis response can be a very valuable learning experience for young people and early-career professionals while helping their communities. However, they can be taken advantage of—expected to take on heavy risks and responsibilities without adequate compensation or protection. Institutions in charge must ensure decent and safe working conditions and proper personal protective equipment. And, in the case of non-voluntary work, young people must be paid fair salaries to prevent the exploitation of cheap youth labor. Working under considerable stress and pressure often results in a significant impact on their physical and mental health.

381,How can I assess whether measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 at my child’s school or college are sufficient?,"To size up a school’s commitment to safety, look for a number of measures. Most importantly, is physical distancing emphasized? Will students be kept in small, fixed groups?
 
It’s really advisable to hold lessons outdoors if possible. Otherwise, ventilation is key—aiming to completely replace indoor air ~3 times/hour. 2 windows (or a window and a door) open should suffice. But keep in mind: In Jerusalem, such plans were abandoned when a heat wave hit.
 
Getting to class presents risks, too. Denmark eased hallway crowding with staggered entrance and exit times. And think about how children travel to school: It does little good to group kids carefully in classroom pods if they mix freely taking public transportation on their way in.
 
There should also be routine COVID-19 testing of teachers. Does the school have a plan for responding to a positive case, and how vulnerable students and teachers are treated?

For example, trick-or-treaters can practice social distancing between groups, sanitize their hands between houses, and wear face coverings (which are likely part of many costumes in some form already).
 
Those passing out candy can also wear masks—or just leave dishes or individual bags of candy out (if they are worried about exposure at the door). Transmission of this virus does not occur with fleeting contact; letting children trick-or-treat is 1 type of activity where I think the risk of transmission is manageable.

The 2005 International Health Regulations established the expectation that countries develop capacities to conduct surveillance to detect and rapidly report infectious disease events that could spread internationally—but enforcement is limited.

The difference: Monoclonals are custom-made in a lab, while convalescent plasma is drawn from recovered COVID-19 patients.
 
Monoclonals are designed to target a specific part of a pathogen—with SARS-CoV-2, they neutralize sites within the “spike protein,” which is the part of the virus that attaches to cells.
 
Thus, a single dose of monoclonal antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 is at least 10X more powerful than that achieved with convalescent plasma, which contains a wide variety of antibodies that may or may not be able to take on the virus.

391,What is the difference between a vaccine's efficacy and effectiveness?,"Efficacy: how well a vaccine performed under EXTREMELY controlled trial conditions (e.g., “if everything was perfect, this is what would happen”).

Effectiveness: how well a vaccine performed in the real world when things go wrong. 

For example: Pfizer actually reported the efficacy, NOT the effectiveness for its COVID-19 vaccine, which was still in Phase 3 trial settings at the time. If this vaccine eventually gets approved for real-world use, it probably won't be as effective as 90% (because stuff happens).

Is that a bad thing? 
 
No! Effectiveness is typically lower than efficacy.
 
One yearly flu vaccine trial found an efficacy of 58%, but studies after real-world use determined an effectiveness of 52%. 
 
The trial needs to collect more data; then, public health experts will need to address various distribution hurdles down the line—but Pfizer’s news signals that the normal process is working and moving in the right direction.

Although the new coronavirus weakens and dies over time outside of the human body, studies suggest that it can live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, depending on surface, temperature and other environmental factors. For instance, a small amount of the new coronavirus is still detectable on plastic surfaces for up to three days, on stainless steel for up to two days and up to one day on cardboard, but it’s at less than 0.1% of the starting virus material. So far, evidence suggests that the virus does not survive as well on a soft surface (such as fabric) as it does on frequently touched hard surfaces like elevator buttons and door handles.

The cases of the tigers in the Bronx Zoo and, more recently, of the two pet cats in New York, should not be cause for public alarm but a reminder that the COVID-19 crisis is actively evolving and that we have yet to learn more about the virus and its effects on both human and animal health.  At this time, experts recommend keeping pets indoors or avoiding socialization of pets with other animals, and maintaining good hygiene when handling or caring for your animals. 
Wash your hands before and after interacting with animals.
Don’t kiss your pets or let them lick you or share your food.
Walk dogs on a leash. Do not allow pets to interact with people or other animals outside of the household.

404,Is the coronavirus airborne?,"Yes, the coronavirus can be transmitted through the air by respiratory droplets. These infectious droplets spread when a person with COVID-19 breathes, talks, sings, coughs or sneezes. The CDC recently updated its information on airborne spread of the coronavirus. Respiratory droplets range in size, but in general they are considered large or small. Large respiratory droplets may be visible, and they fall to the ground relatively close to the person who exhaled them — usually seconds to a minute after they are exhaled. Smaller respiratory droplets, however, may remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours, and they may travel far from the person who exhaled them. The possibility of the coronavirus being contagious through the air is why it is so important to wear a mask at all times when you are around other people. Masks prevent respiratory droplets from spreading, not only when you cough and sneeze, but also when you are talking, singing or exercising. In addition to wearing a face mask, maintaining physical distancing (of at least 6 feet), hand hygiene, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces are important ways to prevent virus transmission. Staying away from poorly ventilated indoor areas and crowded indoor gatherings are critical ways to avoid encountering a concentration of suspended small droplets and particles carrying the coronavirus. The virus may also be spread by touching high-touch surfaces like light switches, door knobs or handrails and then touching your face, mouth or eyes.

430,How can I keep my newborn safe?,"Good hygiene (handwashing) and social distancing are the most effective ways to keep your infant safe from communicable diseases such as COVID-19. All caregivers should be reminded to wash hands thoroughly before touching bottles and other feeding supplies, and before feeding or caring for an infant or child. Continuing to follow all public health recommendations, lining up a symptom-free support person to help drop off supplies, and connecting with friends and family virtually (phone, text, FaceTime, social media) will limit the exposure of the virus/disease to you and your family. While screen time is typically not recommended for infants, connecting to loved ones via video chatting such as FaceTime is considered safe in limited amounts. Ways of keeping your children safe:• Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.• Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer when handwashing is unavailable.• Reduce close contact with others by practicing social distancing. Limit public exposure and avoid unnecessary public contact.• If going out with the child is essential:o Cover the infant carrier (NOT THE INFANT) with a light-weight blanket, which helps protect the baby, but still gives them the ability to breathe comfortably.o Make the trip and time of coverage as brief as possible.o Do not leave the blanket on the carrier in the car or at any time when the baby and carrier are not in direct view by an adult caregiver.o Children only over the age of 2 should wear a mask or cloth face covering.• Keep your children away from others who are sick and keep them home if they are sick.• Teach kids to cough and sneeze into a tissue or their arm or elbow, not their hands.• Clean commonly used surfaces regularly with disinfectant. Clean commonly touched surfaces (e.g., countertops, tables, doorknobs) regularly with disinfectant.• Wash stuffed animals or other plush toys in the warmest water possible, being sure to dry them completely.• Teach children to avoid touching face.• Follow local and state guidance on travel and stay-at-home restrictions.

478,How can I protect myself and my family from contracting COVID-19?,"As this pandemic continues, and communities and businesses across the United States are opening and shutting down at different times and to different degrees, you may be wondering about the real risks to resuming activities, running errands, and attending events and gatherings. There is no way to ensure you have zero risk of infection, so it is important to understand the risks and know how to be as safe as possible. People who are pregnant, and those who live with them, should consider their level of risk before deciding to go out and ensure they are taking steps to protect themselves and others. Consider avoiding activities where taking protective measures may be difficult, such as activities where social distancing can’t be maintained. Everyone should take steps to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19 to protect themselves, their communities, and people who are at increased risk of severe illness. In general, the more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the higher your risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.vii Follow the below guidance to reduce risks of spread. • Frequently wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. • Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when handwashing is unavailable. • Clean commonly used surfaces (e.g., cell phones, personal electronic devices, remote controls, countertops, cabinet handles, tables, doorknobs, light switches) regularly with disinfectant (pregnant women should wear gloves or use green (natural, eco-friendly) products with disinfectant agent, or ideally have another household member clean the surface when possible). • Avoid contact with sick people. • Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. • Cover your coughs (coughing into your elbow). • If you or your family has not yet received vaccines for Influenza, get vaccinated now. • Practice social distancing and staying at home: o Only go out for essential items. o Avoid gathering in groups, if possible. o Keep distance of 6 feet, if you must go out. o Limit contact with other individuals as much as practicable. • Wear masks or cloth face coverings at work and in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies). Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2 due to risk of suffocation and strangulation. Try to avoid being around others who are not wearing masks.

479,How will this outbreak affect my delivery experience?,"It’s hard to predict exactly how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact your labor and delivery experience, but be prepared for likely changes, such as universal testing for COVID-19 prior to admission and limitations on visitors and/or support persons. In most cases, early discharge in an effort to reduce risk of COVID-19 infection has been found to provide no advantage to the newborn and may place additional burden on the family.vi If you are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, you should notify your prenatal care provider and the facility you will be delivering at, prior to arrival, to assist the healthcare team in making the appropriate infection control preparations.ii While you can expect to be required to wear a mask in the hospital or birth center, it is recommended that pregnant women do not wear a mask while pushing during labor, as this may be difficult. For this reason, your health care team should wear masks or other protective breathing equipment. They also may take other steps to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, including wearing goggles or face shields.viii Although this may cause feelings of being anxious or scared, you can be reassured that there will be helpful support from a labor nurse throughout your labor and deliver experience. Your provider and local birth center staff can keep you up-to-date on changes to normal procedures. Although the COVID-19 pandemic may change the labor and birth experience you planned for, it will continue to be safe, special and memorable in so many ways. If you have questions or concerns about what your birthing experience may look like, ask your provider or birthing center staff to walk you through the restrictions and accommodations. During this conversation you can ask questions about having your support person with you, having your infant stay in your room after birth, breastfeeding, mask-wearing, etc. Updated November 18, 2020 i Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Caring for Newborns; updated November 3, 2020; retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html ii Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Pregnancy Data; updated November 13, 2020; retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/special-populations/pregnancy-data-on-covid-19.html iii The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Clinical Guidance; Practice Advisory; Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19); updated July 1, 2020 with summary of key updates made November 6, 2020retrieved from https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/03/novel-coronavirus-2019 iv Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); Caring for Pregnant Women; revised May 20, 2020; retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/inpatient-obstetric-healthcare-guidance.html v Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Caring for Newborns; updated May 20,2020; retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/caring-for-newborns.html vi American Academy of Pediatrics; Critical Updates on COVID-19; Clinical Guidance; FAQs: Management of Infants Born to COVID-19 Mothers; updated 7/22/20; retrieved from https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/faqs-management-of-infants-born-to-covid-19-mothers/ vii The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Patient Resources; FAQ; Coronavirus (COVID-19); Pregnancy and Breastfeeding; updated November, 2020; retrieved from https://www.acog.org/patient-resources/faqs/pregnancy/coronavirus-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding",https://ks-kdhecovid19.civicplus.com/faq.aspx,en,Kansas Department of Health and Environment
480,"What extra precautions can I take to protect my baby if I have, or am suspected of having, COVID-19?","If you have COVID-19 or are suspected of having COVID-19, staying in a different room from your baby is the safest way to keep your newborn healthy. A healthy caregiver should take care of the baby and can feed expressed breast milk. You can stop isolating yourself from your baby once you are fever-free without use of fever medicines (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for at least 24 hours; when your other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving; and when at least 10 days have passed since your symptoms started. If you never had symptoms, you can stop isolating yourself after 10 days have passed since your positive COVID-19 test.i If you and your family decide to keep your baby in the same room as you, keep a distance of at least 6 feet from your baby when possible. When closer than 6 feet, wear a mask and make sure your hands are clean by washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before touching your newborn, or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available.i Be sure not to touch the front of the mask, and change out the mask when it is damp. As always, it is recommended to be in close communication with your health care provider(s) and to follow your provider’s guidance.

481,How else can I help keep my baby safe?,"Safe sleep is an important part of keeping babies healthy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents of babies may experience increased stress and fatigue that could affect their ability to ensure that their baby is sleeping safely. Help reduce your baby’s risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and other sleep-related deaths by doing the following: • Place your baby on his or her back for all sleep times – naps and at night. • Use a firm, flat sleep surface, such as a mattress in a crib covered by a fitted sheet. • Have the baby share your room but not your bed. Your baby shouldn’t sleep on an adult bed, cot, air mattress, couch, or chair, whether he or she is sleeping alone, with you, or with anyone else. • Keep soft bedding, such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, and soft toys, out of your baby’s sleep area. • Do not cover your baby’s head or allow your baby to get too hot. Signs your baby may be getting too hot include sweating or his or her chest feeling hot. • Don’t smoke or allow anyone to smoke around your baby.i Learn more about how to reduce the risk of SIDS.",https://ks-kdhecovid19.civicplus.com/faq.aspx,en,Kansas Department of Health and Environment
482,Are pregnant women at greater risk of contracting COVID-19?,"Based on what we know at this time, pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women.i A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) study found that pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), receive invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO - a treatment that uses a pump to circulate blood through an artificial lung and back into the bloodstream of a very ill person), and are at increased risk of death compared to nonpregnant women.ii Information suggests that pregnant women with comorbidities (more than one disease or condition) such as obesity are at increased risk for severe illness as is the general population with similar comorbidities.iii However, as pregnancy itself has now been identified as a risk factor for certain outcomes, more research is needed to determine the magnitude of this increased risk.ii It is therefore important for pregnant women to take extra precautions to protect themselves from illness and talk with their provider about any concerns they may have.

483,Can COVID-19 cause problems for a pregnancy or be passed on to the unborn baby?,"Although much is still unknown, emerging data, suggests that COVID-19 may activate blood clotting pathways and can lead to excessive inflammation that can cause damage to tissues throughout the body, making a pregnant woman more at risk for complications during the pregnancy and postpartum periods. “Additionally, there may be an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth.”iv Although there are cases reported of transmission of the virus from mom to baby in-utero or during the birthing process, the data are reassuring that this appears to be uncommon.ii Transmission to the baby is thought to occur primarily through respiratory droplets during the postnatal period when neonates are exposed to mothers, other caregivers, visitors, or healthcare personnel with COVID-19v. It is critical that appropriate precautions are taken after delivery to prevent the spread of the virus from the mother to the infant. At this time, experts say there is no need to change the timing or method (cesarean vs. vaginal) of delivery to decrease the risk of spread to the infant.vii Most newborns who have tested positive for COVID-19 had mild or no symptoms and have recovered fully. However, there are a few reports of newborns with severe illness.i In the rare case of infant death, it has not been determined if it was due to the virus or other underlying (original, or already existing) conditions. Current data [gathered through case reviews and the Perinatal COVID-19 Registry] suggest that approximately 2-5% of infants born to women with COVID-19 near the time of delivery have tested positive in the first 24-96 hours after birth. [It is] not yet know[n] if any of the newborns reported to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Registry have become ill at home following hospital discharge. There are few case series of pediatric COVID-19 published to date, but clinicians and families should be aware that there are published reports of infants requiring hospitalization before one month of age due to severe COVID-19 infection.vi Although there is much that is still unknown about this virus and its effect on perinatal women and infants, what we do know tells us how extremely important it is for you and your baby to have frequent follow-up with your medical provider/s during the pregnancy, postpartum, and newborn periods. A nationwide study is taking place now to help pregnant women and the medical community learn more about how COVID-19 effects pregnant women and their newborns. If you are pregnant or recently pregnant and are under investigation for COVID-19 or have been confirmed to have COVID-19, you are encouraged to participate in this study. To learn more about the study and how to enroll, please visit the PRIORITY Study website.

486,For what situations are there quarantine recommendations for exposure to a case?,"If you have been told by a public health professional or other authority that you are a close contact of a laboratory confirmed case of COVID-19, you must quarantine yourself for 7, 10, or 14 days after your last contact with the case depending on whether you have been tested for COVID-19 and preference of local health officer. (See Shortened Quarantine Guidance). You are a ""close contact"" if any of the following situations happened while you spent time with a person with COVID-19, even if they didn’t have symptoms: Were within 6 feet of the person for 10 consecutive minutes or moreHad contact with the person’s respiratory secretions (for example, coughed or sneezed on; kissed; contact with a dirty tissue; shared a drinking glass, food, towels, or other personal items).Live with the person or stayed overnight for at least one night in a house with the person. The chance of spreading the virus is greater the longer an infected person or persons are close to someone. It also matters if the infected person is coughing, sneezing, singing, shouting, or doing anything else that produces more respiratory droplets that contain virus or if there are exposures to more than one infected person. Under these higher risk situations, you may want to consider a close contact someone who has been within 6 feet of an infectious person or persons for 10 cumulative minutes or more in a 24-hour period. The final decision on what constitutes close contact is made at the discretion of public health. People who work in healthcare, public health, law enforcement and the meat packing industry may be allowed a modified quarantine, which allows them to continue working during quarantine period while wearing appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), as long as they remain symptom free. The decision to allow a modified quarantine is made by the local health officer. Employees who were potentially exposed to COVID-19 due to exposure to a case should monitor for signs and symptoms of COVID-19, including checking for a fever of 100.4 (F) or higher at least twice per day and monitoring for lower respiratory symptoms including cough or shortness of breath. Use this symptoms log. If symptoms develop during the quarantine period, employees should stop work immediately and notify their employer and public health. Isolation of Lab-confirmed Cases of COVID-19 Lab-confirmed cases, including healthcare, public health, and law enforcement workers must be isolated in the same manner as any other lab-confirmed case. Most cases are considered no longer infectious and can be released from isolation using this criteria: 10 days from the onset of symptoms OR72 hours after fever is gone without the use of fever reducing medication AND there has been a significant improvement in symptomsWHICHEVER IS LONGER. In some dire circumstances where there is a shortage of healthcare staff, asymptomatic healthcare staff who are positive may be allowed to continue working if they continue to be asymptomatic, are wearing appropriate PPE, are only working with COVID-19 positive patients and cannot expose other staff, and can ensure that no common spaces will be shared with non COVID-19 staff and patients. This exception must be allowed by the county’s local health officer. If you have questions, contact your local county health department, or KDHE at 877-427-7317. KDHE continues to recommend a 14-day quarantine following exposure to COVID-19, as the incubation period for this disease is 14 days. CDC has released modified guidance allowing for shorter quarantine periods to increase better compliance with quarantine and increase people getting tested. Local Health Departments may choose to opt into this guidance. For information in your county, please contact your local health department.  After exposure, you monitor yourself for symptoms daily or participate in monitoring by Public Health for 7 full days.If you have no symptoms during this time frame, on or after Day 5, you may get a PCR test (antigen and antibody tests are NOT allowed for this purpose).If the test is negative, and you remain symptom-free, you can be removed from quarantine on or after Day 8.If Testing Results are pending, you must wait until you receive results.   After exposure, you monitor yourself for symptoms daily or participate in Public Health monitoring for 10 full days.If you have no symptoms during the 10 days, you can be released from the quarantine without a test on Day 11. KDHE recommends all exposed people should self-monitor for fourteen (14) days from exposure and contact healthcare provider if symptoms develop. Disease can still develop through day 14.

500,Where can I find a mask? The stores are all sold out. I want to wear one to protect myself when I go out in public.,"Do not use surgical masks or N95 masks. These masks are considered specialized personal protective equipment (PPE) and should be reserved for first responders and health care workers to protect from serious injuries or illnesses while doing their jobs. If you have supplies of PPE, consider donating them. Homemade masks are NOT meant to replace proven public health strategies like staying home, social distancing and practicing good hygiene, which are all still the best ways to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. If used correctly, masks are simply another tool to help people who may have the virus -- but don’t know it -- from transmitting it to others. KDHE recommends wearing a mask that fits snuggly around the nose, mouth and chin and has multiple layers of fabric. Alternatively, a thinner disposable mask may be worn underneath a cloth face mask to improve the fit. Visit KDHE’s Mask Guidance for more information.  To use a homemade mask safely and effectively, remember this helpful acronym: M.A.S.K.M = Multi-layered, tightly-woven 100% cotton --180+ thread count. Don’t buy surgical or N95 masks.A = Avoid your face. Never touch the front of the mask. Always remove it from behind your head.S = Scrap it if it’s damaged, soiled or doesn’t fit. Make sure it’s breathable and fits snug. Don’t use while it’s damp, wet or dirty.K = Keep the mask and your hands clean. Wash your hands before and after use. Wash or dispose the mask after every use. Learn how to make a mask. Learn about children and masks.",https://ks-kdhecovid19.civicplus.com/faq.aspx,en,Kansas Department of Health and Environment
501,Should staff wear masks when caring for children?,"Both the CDC and KDHE recommend the use of masks in public and other settings where physical distancing measures are difficult to maintain. KDHE recommends wearing a mask that fits snuggly around the nose, mouth and chin and has multiple layers of fabric. Alternatively, a thinner disposable mask may be worn underneath a cloth face mask to improve the fit. For more information, visit https://www.coronavirus.kdheks.gov/DocumentCenter/View/441/KDHE-MaskGuidance-PDF---3-1-21. Local health officials and employers can apply additional health and safety requirements, including the use of masks in child care settings. When masks are worn, care should be taken to avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth when removing and to wash hands immediately after removing. Masks should be washed frequently. Staff wearing masks should consider the speech and language skills of young children as visual access to caregivers’ mouths is critical to infant/toddler speech development. Additionally, be aware that young children may try to touch or remove the mask from their caregiver which could result in contamination. Licensees should consult with parents before routinely requiring 9 | Page 3/11/2021 10:01 AM children in care to wear a mask. If feasible and necessary, children two years of age and older may safely wear masks once they are able to: put one on and remove it without assistance and are able to avoid touching or sucking on it. Masks should not be placed on anyone—adult or child—who has trouble breathing, is unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove their mask without assistance. More information about the use of masks and facial coverings is available on the KDHE COVID-19 Resource Center and CDC website. CDC also has specific Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open. A note about face shields (made of see-through material and covering the entire face): KDHE is not recommending that face shields be routinely used by young children in child care settings, with or without a mask. CDC does not recommend the use of a face shield for normal everyday activities or as a substitute for masks. Additionally, CDC guidance specifically states that plastic face shields for newborns and infants are NOT recommended. It isn’t known if face shields provide any benefit as a control measure to protect others from the spray of respiratory particles. Some adults may choose to use a face shield when sustained close contact with others is expected. If used without a mask, a face shield should wrap around the sides of the individual’s face and extend below the chin. Disposable face shields should only be used one time. Reusable face shields should be cleaned and disinfected after each use.",https://ks-kdhecovid19.civicplus.com/faq.aspx,en,Kansas Department of Health and Environment
502,Is it safe to breastfeed my baby?,"Yes. “The AAP strongly supports breastfeeding as the best choice for infant feeding.”v Breast milk provides protection against many illnesses and is the best source of nutrition for most infants. Breastfed infants are generally less likely to have severe respiratory symptoms if they get sick. Breastfeeding is good for moms, releasing hormones during breastfeeding that promote wellness and can relieve stress and anxiety. Breast milk is readily available, and especially important during emergencies.  “Several published studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in breast milk. It is not yet known whether viable, infectious virus is secreted in breast milk, nor is it yet established whether protective antibody is found in breast milk. Given these uncertainties, breastfeeding is not contraindicated at this time.”v For moms who are infected with COVID-19, breastfeeding directly and pumping breast milk to be fed via bottle by an uninfected caregiver are both options for providing the best nutrition (breast milk) to babies. COVID-19 spreads between people who are in close contact, mainly through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Therefore, if the person feeding the baby by breast or bottle is COVID+ or has been potentially exposed, he/she should wear a face mask or mouth/nose covering and wash their hands before each feeding, as well as during breast milk pumping and/or any bottle preparation, to reduce the risk of transmission. One should always wash hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before breastfeeding or expressing breast milk, even if not COVID+. All bottle, breast pump parts and supplies should be cleaned thoroughly following CDC guidelines. For more information please review resources about COVID-19 and breastfeeding provided by the Kansas Breastfeeding Coalition. As always, it is important to talk with your doctor and a breastfeeding support professional to weigh the risks and benefits and help determine what is best in an individual situation.

503,What symptoms should I be watching for in my baby?,"Most babies who test positive for COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms. Severe illness in babies appears to be rare. Babies with underlying medical conditions and babies born premature (before 37 weeks) might be at increased risk of severe illness. Reported signs among newborns with COVID-19 include fever, lethargy (being overly tired or inactive), runny nose, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding and increased work of breathing or shallow breathing.x Monitor for fever and call your baby’s provider if he/she has a fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, even if there are no other symptoms. If your baby develops symptoms or you think your baby may have been exposed to COVID-19, call your baby’s healthcare provider within 24 hours and follow steps for caring for children with COVID-19.x Symptoms to be aware and ready to report to your provider include: • How well is your baby feeding? • How alert is your baby? • How many wet diapers is your baby having? • How hard is your baby working at breathing? • Have you noticed any discoloration of your baby’s lips?

512,How do outbreaks normally end?,"There are several ways that an outbreak can come to an end. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak was controlled through close coordination between public health officials and clinicians who were able to diagnose cases, isolate infected patients, trace their contacts, and implement strong infection control policies. An outbreak can dwindle once the virus has infected most of the people who are susceptible to it, because it has fewer targets, as was the case with the Zika virus outbreaks in recent years.

CDC recommends using breathable cloth such as 100 percent cotton, with two layers of fabric for optimal filtering. When held up to a bright light, the fabric should not let a lot of light shine through. Face coverings should:  Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face; Be secured with ties or ear loops; Allow for breathing without restriction; Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape;  Face masks are not recommended for children less than age two years or by individuals who have trouble breathing or who cannot easily remove them. N-95 respirators are in short supply and should be reserved for healthcare professionals and other first responders. Remember: Face masks are not a substitute for other preventive measures—continue to wash your hands properly, avoid touching your face, and maintain social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart from others) in conjunction with wearing face masks in public spaces.",https://www.nfid.org/infectious-diseases/frequently-asked-questions-about-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/,en,Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 – National Foundation for Infectious Diseases
521,What tests are available to detect COVID-19?,"There are currently three types of COVID-19 tests authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA):  ; Molecular tests are used to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Molecular tests are fairly accurate and can be used to diagnose the disease.; ; Antigen tests are a new category of tests that can quickly detect fragments of the virus from nasal swabs. Antigen tests can provide results in minutes, but they are not as sensitive as molecular tests. Positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, but negative results may need to be confirmed with a molecular test.; ; Antibody (or serology) tests detect the body’s immune response to COVID-19 by looking for antibodies in the blood to help determine prior exposure. When the body is fighting an infection or has fought an infection, antibodies can be found in the blood. These tests do not detect the actual virus but are used to identify people who have been infected with the virus in the past.;  FDA has authorized more than 100 tests for emergency use including 91 molecular tests, 12 serology tests, and 1 antigen test. Accuracy varies among all of the tests. The resulting uncertainty can complicate public health decisions. Some antibody tests have a high potential for false-negative and false-positive results. They may not be able to detect antibodies in the blood of someone who is newly infected, and they may not be able to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses. The presence of antibodies may indicate immunity from COVID-19, but that has not yet been conclusively proven; nor do scientists know the duration of protection. Although serologic tests should not be used at this time to determine if an individual is immune, these tests can help determine the proportion of a population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and provide information about populations that may be immune and potentially protected. Serologic test results should not be used to make decisions about returning to school or the workplace. Additional data are needed before modifying public health recommendations based on serologic test results, including decisions on discontinuing physical distancing and using personal protective equipment.

There are many vaccine candidates in various stages of testing around the world to evaluate their safety and effectiveness, including some that are based on proven technologies and some that use innovative approaches. One vaccine has received authorization for emergency use in the US and has been recommended for use in individuals age 16 years and older for the prevention of COVID-19. View Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) Interim Recommendation for additional details. Because the supply of COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be limited at first, CDC recommends that initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccine be allocated to healthcare professionals and long-term care facility residents. All vaccines used in the US—including those being developed for COVID-19—are required to go through extensive safety testing before they are licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or recommended for widespread use. Vaccine safety standards will not be compromised in efforts to speed development of new vaccines for COVID-19. All necessary steps are being followed and although these steps usually happen sequentially, because of the urgency of the pandemic, some steps are happening simultaneously. For example, manufacturers are scaling up production of vaccines that may never be licensed. If rigorous studies show that the vaccines are safe and effective, once FDA approves their licensure and they are recommended for use by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, vaccines will be ready to distribute across the US.",https://www.nfid.org/infectious-diseases/frequently-asked-questions-about-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/,en,Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 – National Foundation for Infectious Diseases

528,Can I give blood?,"You can. Donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, but transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth.
The American Red Cross is collecting donations at blood banks, which have enacted new safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Those measures include checking the temperatures of staff members and donors before they enter a drive facility, providing hand sanitizer for use before and during the donation process, enhancing their disinfection of surfaces and equipment, and spacing beds — when possible — to enable social distancing between donors.
And even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the donation center. 
To find a donation center, check the American Association of Blood Banks locator, visit the Red Cross website or call 1-800-RED-CROSS.

529,I’ve recovered from Covid-19. How do I donate plasma?,"To qualify, donors must pass normal blood-donation requirements and be symptom-free of Covid-19 for at least 14 days, and, in most cases, must have positive results from a test. (Other restrictions may apply, depending on the organization.)
Many health care institutions nationwide are involved in plasma donations, including the Red Cross, so to find a location near you go to the website for the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project or visit the Red Cross’s website.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for Covid-19, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee’s name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus. 
Many states have stay-at-home orders, but even if your employment is exempt and requires you to come in, you could still ask about working from home. Otherwise, you’d probably have to use paid time off or take a leave of absence — if that’s an option.

531,Am I depressed or just in a bad mood?,"There’s already evidence that growing numbers of people are depressed. From Feb. 16 to March 15, the number of antidepressant prescriptions filled in the United States rose by 18.6 percent. A University of Michigan survey of some 460 people, conducted in mid-April, found 33.6 percent of respondents reported symptoms of major depression, including fatigue, insomnia and feelings of hopelessness.
Most experts expect to see rates of depression and other psychological disorders increase in the coming months, as the pandemic continues. And yet, a majority of those who seek treatment for depression will improve if they persist.
Even so, mental health specialists are reluctant to label what people are experiencing as depression, in the usual sense.
“I don’t know anyone right now that’s not having depression-like symptoms,” said Luana Marques, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and the president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. “It’s hard to keep going when our brains are constantly on fight or flight. It makes people really tired. If you’re having trouble concentrating or getting out of bed, it’s not abnormal. It’s an evolutionary response to a threat.”
Familiarize yourself with depression’s physical and mental markers. Or take a self-diagnostic test. When depression isn’t severe, a self-care routine may be enough.

532,How do I help my kids entertain themselves without socializing?,"Maybe don’t. Let them amuse themselves.
That’s tough: Research has shown that our heavily scheduled lives have contributed to a significant decrease in the amount of free time kids have, so their independent play skills may not be ready for the moment we are facing.
But it might really be necessary. “Independent play encourages time management, executive function and organizational skills, and emotional and physical awareness and regulation,” said Dana Rosenbloom, a parent and child educator in Manhattan. “All skills that help us be successful individuals as adults.”
You can help them play on their own. Start slow — let younger kids direct play for 20 minutes, 35, then an hour. Keep toys out of rotation, said Avital Schreiber-Levy, a parenting performance coach in New Jersey who has created a play guide for parents on lockdown. “When toys sit out too long, they go stale,” she said. “It’s about making them novel again, either because we take them away or we set them up in a new way.”
Let kids get messy, and keep play in a specific zone where they can wiggle and jump. And, be patient. If your kid is used to socializing and screentime, self-directed play might be tough for them. Letting them work out the kinks on their own will develop strength and resiliency that can last them a lifetime.

If you are practicing social distancing and making only occasional trips to the grocery store or pharmacy, experts say that it’s not necessary to change clothes or take a shower when you return home.

Almost a month after the phase 1 reopening of New York City that allowed contractors and their crews back into residential buildings, “we’re redefining what ‘full steam ahead’ means,” said Steve Mark, the chief executive of SMI Construction. “It’s not going to mean what it used to.”
It’s a tough balance as contractors and homeowners try to navigate restrictions, but hammers are banging once more.

535,Why is six feet away the right distance?,"The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. Six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet.
But some scientists have looked at studies of air flow and are concerned about smaller particles called aerosols. They suggest that people consider a number of factors, including their own vulnerability and whether they are outdoors or in an enclosed room, when deciding whether six feet is enough distance.
Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study.
It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you’re far enough apart.

Gloves may be helpful if someone in your household becomes sick, so you can reduce the amount of times you have to wash your hands. But you will have to change the gloves every time you leave their room or interact with the sick person. 
The most effective intervention is still washing your hands thoroughly, for at least 20 seconds, every time you enter your home.

* Stand with one arm out in front of you and your palm facing the ground.
* With your other hand, gently pull the fingers of the outstretched arm back. You should feel the stretch in the underside of your wrist.
* Hold for a moment or two, then release.
* Next, keeping your arm straight, use your other hand to push your fingers and palm down and toward your body. Hold a few seconds, then release.
* Repeat with your other arm.
Don’t forget to stretch and strengthen your whole body, too. See The Times’s 9-Minute Strength Workout, which includes exercises you can do in a pinch.

538,When should I go to the hospital?,"Going to the hospital should not be your first interaction with a doctor. 
If you’re feeling sick, speak with a medical professional over the phone and get a test. If you can, consult with a doctor before you go to a medical center or the hospital — they might have insights or suggestions. 
As soon as symptoms start, mark the days. While most patients recover in about a week, a significant minority of patients enter “a very nasty second wave” of illness, said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta. “After the initial symptoms, things plateau and maybe even improve a little bit, and then there is a secondary worsening.”

539,What about the dentist?,"Taking care of your pearly whites is not just a good beauty habit; it’s also essential for your health. With all the baking and drinking we’ve been doing during lockdown, you’re going to need a visit sooner rather than later. In fact, that’s part of the reason economists are using dentists as a bellwether for comfort about reopening writ large.
Dentists have mobilized and are ready to accommodate visitors. (Telehealth, for obvious reasons, isn’t an option for most dental cases.) Dentists and hygienists should wear head-to-toe personal protective equipment and change between appointments.
Getting the first appointment of the day may also limit risk, though many dentists said they are seeing fewer patients so they have more time to disinfect rooms between visits. But the risk might be more to the providers than it is to the patients; they keep their mask on while you take yours off. 
Before you go, speak with your dentist about how crucial your check-up is right now. If cases are rising where you live, maybe check back in next month if your dental issue can wait.

They should give you advice on how to get tested and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that if you’re sick or think you’re sick, but only mildly ill, you should isolate yourself, and you shouldn’t leave your house except to go to the doctor.
But a lot of people get the coronavirus without showing many, or any, symptoms. That’s why you should always wear a mask outside your home — the only surefire way to know you don’t have it is to get a test. And tests are still not reliable.

541,My partner wants to go out more than I do. What should we do?,"You are going to have to work together to weigh each other’s needs. One partner might have parents who are older and at higher risk of complications from the coronavirus; the other might be an extrovert who thrives on being around other people and is, emotionally, at a breaking point.
Remember that you’re on the same team. “It’s not, ‘My needs versus your needs, and let’s negotiate,’ but asking the question and having the posture of: ‘What is best for our relationship?’” said Jennifer Bullock, a psychotherapist based in Philadelphia.
Several psychologists and counselors recommended presenting a united front when explaining shared decisions to friends and family. Any sort of “I would, but he’s afraid” seeds resentment and can amplify the problem far past the boundaries of your own home.
In any fraught situation, sit down with your partner and listen. Instead of offering rebuttals, try to treat it more like an interview about where he or she is coming from. Ask open-ended questions — which can’t be answered with a simple “yes” or “no.” You could try: “How should we approach our safety when I go back to the office?”
But remember, this is a pandemic. If one person is seriously scared about their health or the health of their family, their needs might take priority. Ultimately, your well-being and others’ should take precedence.

542,What does the virus do to my body?,"In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness — many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome — which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet — and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe.
By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don’t show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed.
Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one’s sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes — nicknamed “Covid toe” — but few other serious symptoms.
More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.

544,What about a funeral?,"There are steps you can take to treat the dead with dignity. 
If someone you love is in hospice or nearing the end, start planning. Death is always logistical. Now, it’s even more so. Call a few funeral homes to ask about pricing and procedure, and check your state laws on the size of the gathering.
If your religion mandates you bury someone within a specific period of time, turn to a religious leader for help. They will have worked with other people in your situation, and should have suggestions about how to cope. 
Understand that as much as you would like to honor your loved one in your traditional ways, the changed world has also affected funeral services. Consider the risk of a funeral gathering, and the comfort levels and health concerns of those who would like to attend. You may choose to organize a smaller in-person memorial, schedule a service at a later date or hold a Zoom memorial.
As for grieving? It’s going to be hard. You cannot hug your friends, and you cannot have them over. But with technology, you can lean on your community virtually. Maybe that’s just regular phone calls to your support network over the first few weeks. Or maybe that’s a Zoom shiva or wake. If you go the videoconferencing route, ask everyone to show up with a memory or a poem to share. Call on people one by one. 
If your friend lost someone they loved, send a condolence note or sympathy card. It means a lot, even over email.

545,What about laundromats?,"In confined spaces, droplets spread. The C.D.C. suggests that, while doing the laundry of a sick person, you should wear gloves and try not to shake the clothing, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. But you can wash their laundry with everyone else’s. 
That being said, the C.D.C. also says that surfaces contaminated with droplets of the virus can infect people, it is “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” We know that’s contradictory information. Safe is always better than sorry, though, and if you’re living with someone sick, it’s always good to take precautions. 
At the laundromat, if you leave your home to wash your clothes, don’t hang out in the room between cycles. Sit in your car or lounge outside as you wait, just for social distancing purposes.

Instead of self-flagellating, use this as an opportunity to reset. Politely decline Zoom calls if you’re tired of them. Don’t feel like you need to eat outside with someone until you’re ready. It is a good time to take stock: Who and what is important to me, and who and what do I want in my life after all of this? 
Also, it has never been easier to politely decline plans. Just tell someone you’re wiped out from life right now. Real friends will understand.

547,I am not really eating normally. What should I do?,"If you are eating differently, you might be able to manage the change on your own. If you are snacking a lot, that’s OK. But if it bothers you, try to assess whether you are actually hungry and, if so, try to add fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can.
If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate. Schedule your mealtimes like any other essential appointment. You can also set alarms as reminders to drink some water, or to eat something.
But eating disorders can be serious, even life threatening. Roughly one in 10 Americans struggle with disordered eating, and the pandemic has created new hurdles for those managing difficult relationships with food.
“When the world feels out of control, people want to have control over something,” said Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist at Washington University in St. Louis who treats patients with eating and other mental health disorders. “Often, it’s what you put in your mouth.”
So if you are struggling, speak with people you trust and consider seeking professional help.

548,But will not socializing with other children stunt my kid’s development?,"Probably not, although it does make sense to worry.  
Social interactions are an important part of development throughout childhood, and spending time with peers is typically part of that process. But try not to fret too much about what kids are missing right now. Children are resilient and adaptable, and they’re not entirely cut off from other people. 
There is much to be gained from interactions with parents, siblings and even pets. Time alone is valuable, too. And connection through technology, like hanging out or playing games through video chats, can fill in some of the blanks. Even without peer interaction for a while, kids can still develop socially and emotionally in ways that will prepare them to pursue real-world friendships when those can resume. 
Friendship is like riding a bicycle. You don’t really forget how, even if you have some time away.

549,What about socializing with other children? Can we do it safely?,"Maybe. 
If your family or friends live nearby, consider linking up quar-pods. If you as parents agree to community norms and guidelines, you can probably let your kids play together as if the world were normal. 
But if you’re unable to do that, or you want to see someone for a play date, know that there are risks. Playgrounds are open in some states, and young children are being asked to stay six feet apart and wear masks, an often unrealistic expectation.
If you’re trying for a play date, good communication with a parent is essential. 
“A start would be, ‘Hi, our kids have been asking about getting together, and as you know, this is a complicated conversation right now,’” said Dr. Dipesh Navsaria, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. A parent could continue, “I wanted to start with an open conversation, see where you are, tell you where I am, and see if it’s possible to send a consistent message to our kids.”
Enlist your kids for help, too. If they feel like it’s a project that they’re doing together, they might find some way to enjoy it. You could make spaces — all of the kids get their own blanket — if you’re playing outside. 
But there’s no good answer to this. If you can keep your kids away from other kids, you’re reducing your family’s risk of infection. That might not be possible, but it might also be the only way to do it safely.

550,What should I consider when ordering food?,"Both takeout and delivery are safer than eating in restaurants, because social distancing is possible. And, good news, packaging has a low risk of transmitting the disease. Although the C.D.C. says that surfaces contaminated with droplets of the virus can infect people, the agency notes that it is “not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”
Delivery, though, is slightly safer because of contactless delivery, which lets workers leave food at your door, said Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. Since the ordering and payment can be done electronically, customers and workers never need to touch.
If you choose to pick your food up, ask the restaurant staff member to put the food down and walk away before you pick it up. Wear a mask. Stand far apart from other patrons. And whether you choose takeout or delivery, try to pay in advance. You can do it electronically, which will keep both you and the workers safer.

551,"As the world is reopening, I’m anxious. What should I do?","Lots of people with anxiety are struggling more than usual, and lots of people who haven't been anxious before are dealing with symptoms. With different messages coming from varying levels of the government, people can be left feeling as if there are few reliable answers about what precautions they should take or without a clear sense of whether things are under control.
“Uncertainty drives anxiety,” said Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist at Boston University and the author of “How to Be Yourself: Quiet Your Inner Critic and Rise Above Social Anxiety.” “Anxiety is rooted in not knowing what is going to happen.”
Just because the world is reopening, you don’t have to start living your life as if it’s before the pandemic. Instead of focusing on what frightens you, think of the things that you want to have back in your life  that would enrich and fulfill you. Ease back in with activities that you actually want to do, and view this time as an opportunity, weighing whether you want to continue past relationships and activities.
Feel free, also, to tell people what your boundaries are, or name the awkwardness. You might just ask what the other person feels comfortable with. “Should we elbow bump? Do you want to go first? I guess I’ll take the next elevator, right?”
“A problem shared is a problem halved,” Dr. Hendriksen said. “Naming the uncertainty is helpful because it shatters the illusion that there is a right way to do this.”

But it’s not just direct contact that can cause transmission. After pressure from researchers, the W.H.O. conceded that the virus can be transmitted through particles that can linger in the air for hours after an infected person has left. 
The nastiest recent revelation is, perhaps, that flushing a toilet can also spread the virus throughout a bathroom.

Tara Parker-Pope, founding editor of Well, posed this conundrum to Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech and one of the world’s leading experts on airborne disease transmission. Dr. Marr calculated that the risk of transmission is surprisingly low if both people are wearing a mask -- in part because the duration is so brief.
“If you don’t talk or cough while hugging, the risk should be very low,” Dr. Marr told her.
A few tips for lowering the risk further: Wear a mask. Do it outside. Turn your heads away from one another (no cheek-to-cheek, dear). Don’t linger: you don’t want to breathe into each other’s faces. Wash your hands afterward.
Of course, if you’re really worried about it, you can make a “hug glove” with a clear tarp with sleeves. It’s like an umbrella for your entire body.

This is, though, probably a stressful time to be pregnant, especially since there’s so much that’s still uncertain. Here’s what we know: 
Pregnant people might be at increased risk from severe illness from Covid-19, according to the C.D.C. Pregnant people might also be at risk of interruptions to their pregnancies, such as a preterm birth. And a study of pregnant Black and Latino people in Philadelphia shows they have an increased chance of being exposed to coronavirus, which bolsters other research showing that the coronavirus disproportionately affects Black and Latino people. 
Experts are cautiously optimistic that the coronavirus won’t alter fetal development, although one study found strong evidence that a baby was infected with the virus in the womb. A more common concern is that the parent carrying the child is at increased risk of suffering complications if infected. the C.D.C. has a really comprehensive FAQ that will be worth a look. Massachusetts General Hospital does, too.

And in many states, that's the situation. Many re-openings have been followed by a surge of new cases. When you do visit businesses or are otherwise out and about, maintain your social distance and keep your mask on. Just because many Americans are bored of the pandemic, it doesn’t mean it’s over.

558,Should my kid get a flu shot?,"YES. (Sorry to be extra, but, YES.) 
As any parent knows, cold and flu season always brings a host of respiratory viruses and runny noses, but this year there’s the possibility of getting both the flu and Covid-19. So public health leaders are urging everyone to get the flu vaccine to both protect ourselves and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed with sick patients.
If your child is younger than 9, keep in mind that they might need two flu shots: their immune system isn’t strong enough to launch a response after one. And get their shot early — Sept. or Oct. That way, they’ll be protected from early flu season. But you might also get it out of the way before the coronavirus flares up again in cool weather.

559,I have antibodies. Am I now immune?,"People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins found in the blood made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that’s perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University.
The real problem is that your antibody test may be inaccurate, according to guidelines issued in September by a major medical society. Some tests look for the wrong antibodies and even the right antibodies may fade away.
Because current tests cannot determine if someone is immune, the Infectious Diseases Society of America said, antibody tests “cannot inform decisions to discontinue physical distancing or lessen the use of personal protective equipment.”

561,I’m worried my kid isn’t actually learning much through remote school.,"For many of us, this year has been an epic fail. And unfortunately, that failure is extending to a lot of our kids’ education — in staggering numbers.
“We’re obviously dealing with unprecedented learning loss and course failure,” Brian T. Woods, a Texas superintendent, said, “and it’s going to take years to mitigate.”
Across the country, from Houston to Washington, D.C., to Chicago, kids are failing at much higher rates than before — up 42 percent from 11 percent for a normal year in Houston, for example.
Declining literacy rates are particularly concerning. An overwhelming amount of data shows that if kids aren’t reading by the third grade, they may never catch up — and they’re more likely to drop out of high school.
Now, if your kid’s grades were better in the spring but have plummeted in the fall, that’s not necessarily a reflection on your child: Schools often inflated grades at the start of the pandemic in an effort to keep things less stressful as everyone got acclimated. The problem is we’ve still not adjusted and the grading system is now becoming evidence of that. 
Of course, this semester’s grades are generally less a reflection on our children and more on how the school system is handling the seismic shift in education this year. (Isn’t it nice to have someone else to blame, parents?) 
Many children have still not returned to the physical classroom — their schools shuttered since the spring. Disrupted class schedules, online learning and unequal resourcing across districts and within homes have all teamed up against our children at the expense of their learning. 
And kids with slow internet or who are sharing devices with siblings on similar school schedules, or who are still without an electronic device to tune in — are at a still far greater disadvantage.
In California, seven families have sued the state, saying in the lawsuit that remote learning has heightened inequality in the classrooms and infringed on the rights of “low-income and minority students” from receiving an education. 
For ideas about how to make sure your kid keeps up, head to the next question.

562,How can I keep my kid on track?,"Here are a few tips to keep your kids engaged in the remote classroom. (Most of these tips are good personal reminders for the working parent, too.):
1. Don’t let them study in bed: If your kids aren’t asleep, they shouldn’t be in bed. Instead, create a space with your children that fosters a good learning environment — one that separates work from the rest of life, says Donald M. Rattner, a New York-based architect who specializes in creating productive home and office spaces.
2. Pick a space away from other distractions (like the television) and where they have room to move around. If you can position their desks by a window to let in natural light, that’s even better. Create separate spaces with curtains, screens or an extra sheet. And let your children take some leadership in creating their space, adding artwork, fun pencils or a favorite photo. The in-home classroom should be a place the kids want to be. 
Just be sure that the work space includes all their necessary school supplies. (Nothing wastes time like walking all over the house in search of a sharpened pencil or that long-lost password to login.) In fact, depending on the age and needs of your child — as well as the layout of your home or apartment — you may set up offices as though your kid is the co-worker in the next cubicle over. 
You have an important work call, your kid has a test, or maybe one of you just needs a moment’s peace? Signal that. Color-coded cards (green for ‘go,’ red for ‘don’t even think about it’) on the space dividers can signal when each of you can invade the other’s space. 
3. Set a strict routine. Just because you’re not jumping out of bed and rushing to school every morning doesn’t mean that some parts of that morning routine can’t stay the same. Work on a schedule with your children — one that they are happy with and that works with your own schedule (you matter, too!). 
Then help them keep to it. Set a time to wake up, eat breakfast and, yes, change out of pajamas. And be sure to follow the same rules as the kids. No just-coffee-for-breakfast hypocrites in the house, please.
4. Set daily goals. Sharing these goals with family members can give everyone ownership of their day and create self- and group-accountability, as well as compassion toward others in the house. If people are lagging behind, remind one another of your goals and see what you can do to meet them even after the inevitable hiccups in the day.
5. Transitions are natural — just don’t get caught up. You can’t be productive every moment of the day. Kids need breaks (and so do you) for snacks, recess — and, yes, even naps! — to process the day. Build that into the routine. 
6. Get up and get moving. Take breaks to go outside, get some exercise or even just move around a bit inside the house. 
7. Remember to engage with your child. There’s a reason children are always asking “Why?” They, too, are invested in the meaning of what we do day in and day out. And some of that gets lost in a virtual environment. Try to connect their work to an everyday example in which you’ve used the material they’re learning. 
8. Keep in touch with the teachers. Just because you can’t go to parent-teacher conferences right now doesn’t mean you can’t check in and voice concerns or ask for help. This is a school year for the record books. So have compassion for the teachers who are up against even more than usual. (And that’s saying something.)
9. Keep your distance, too. While younger kids need more help logging on and staying on — their fine motor skills aren’t fully developed yet — older kids don’t need someone peering over their shoulder every few seconds. (And you have better ways to spend your time, too.) If your child needs help and you’re equipped to provide it, then schedule some time outside of class to work together. And be sure to mark an end to the school day. In pre-Covid times, the school bus ride or walk home from school was a nice cue that the day was over — at least before the homework began. But now since all work is homework, when work is finished, find cues for both students and parents that the day is done: Close the computer, stop checking email — you’re transitioning back into the life part of that work-life balance.
10. Remember, tomorrow is a new day. You might not be trained as a teacher or have expected to be a full-time worker, caregiver and teacher all at once: You’ll make mistakes and so will the kids. Give them grace. Give yourself grace. Give everyone grace again and again and again. You can work the kinks out with each new day.

563,Which doctor visits should I be avoiding? When should I still go?,"Taking care of your health is important and keeping up with vaccinations, screenings, dental care and other appointments shouldn’t be delayed. Things of course have changed: You’ll need to check with the medical office first and take some basic precautions, like wearing a mask and arriving early for fever checks and screening questions.
 
If you experience symptoms or an injury that would have required an emergency room visit before, you should still seek emergency care. (Remember, the E.R. is for life-threatening situations like chest pain, numbness or tingling that could signal stroke, breathing difficulties or serious injuries.) 
 
If you have or believe you have Covid-19, you should call to check in with your doctor, especially if you are in a high-risk category. Most of the time, you’ll be advised to monitor your symptoms at home, including checking your oxygen levels with a home fingertip pulse oximeter. If your oxygen level goes to 93 percent or lower, seek medical care. If you have trouble breathing or experience other concerning symptoms, contact your doctor or go to the nearest E.R.
 
As for non-emergency medical needs, you have a few options. One of the best things we’ve learned during the pandemic is that doctors and patients can accomplish a lot with telehealth — online video medical visits. And if case counts are rising in your area and hospitals are overwhelmed, doctors may need to delay some care, particularly elective procedures. 
 
But don’t make the decision to skip out on important medical care without talking to your doctor first. Medical offices are taking extensive precautions to keep everyone — the staff and the patients — safe from the virus, and chances are that you will be able to keep your appointment. Call ahead to learn how your medical providers are handling the inflow of patients. (Here are questions to be sure to ask, as well as a set of guidelines, courtesy of the Mayo Clinic.)
 
Many people have already delayed doctor visits — and in some cases that can be dangerous. In May almost half of American adults say they or someone they live with had put off medical visits, according to data collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Hospitals have also rescheduled at different points of the pandemic.)
 
It shouldn’t need to be said, but apparently it needs to be said: don’t avoid the doctor or hospital if you truly need their services. In April emergency medical services in Newark made 239 on-scene death pronouncements — four times the number that time last year — and less than half directly tied to Covid-19, meaning the virus may be indirectly taking the lives of many more, who may not be going to the doctor either out of fear or because they suddenly find themselves uninsured. 
 
On the other hand, while demand for face-lifts sky-rocketed this summer, now is probably not the best time for one. We’ve all seen you on Zoom. You’re not fooling anyone anyway.

564,How should I decide where and how to go to stores?,"This is a hard question to answer. The increasing moves to reopen businesses reflect the immense political and societal pressures weighing on the nation’s governors, even as epidemiologists remain cautious and warn of a second wave of cases this fall.
Since the spring, through, a lot of businesses have learned how to welcome customers safely. Temperature checks at the door probably don’t do much, but mandatory masks and limits on the amount of people who can enter at one time do. 
In general, here are things to keep in mind. If you have a choice between outside and inside, choose outside. You’re less likely to get or give the virus outdoors because it can hang in the still indoor air. And if you have to go inside, wear a mask as you possibly can. 
To reduce your risk of exposure, consider what most people will be doing at various businesses. Where are people going to feel most at ease, and where will they most want to get close to one another and remove their masks? At a store, you can do your best to get in and get out.
But at businesses that exist for socialization, that’s a lot harder. Bars can be loud, and alcohol is flowing. Gyms are inherently germy, and working out in a mask is hard. Dining in restaurants is tricky: Tables are close, you’re eating so you cannot keep your mask on, and waiters keep dropping by to check up on you.

565,Will mRNA vaccines change my genes?,"No. The vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer use a genetic molecule to prime the immune system. That molecule, known as mRNA, is eventually destroyed by the body. 
The mRNA is packaged in an oily bubble that can fuse to a cell, allowing the molecule to slip in. The cell uses the mRNA to make proteins from the coronavirus, which can stimulate the immune system.
At any moment, each of our cells may contain hundreds of thousands of mRNA molecules, which they produce in order to make proteins of their own. Once those proteins are made, our cells then shred the mRNA with special enzymes. The mRNA molecules our cells make can only survive a matter of minutes. The mRNA in vaccines is engineered to withstand the cell's enzymes a bit longer, so that the cells can make extra virus proteins and prompt a stronger immune response. But the mRNA can only last for a few days at most before they are destroyed.

566,"If I am exposed to the virus, do I need to quarantine?","For those who worry about potential exposure, the C.D.C. has amended its quarantining recommendations. While the agency still says that quarantining for 14 days is the safest option, in December the C.D.C. proposed two, easier alternatives.
 
If you don’t have symptoms, then you can quarantine for 10 days. Otherwise, you can cut your time in quarantine in half to 7 days by taking either a P.C.R. or rapid test and getting a negative result. If you choose the testing option, it should be taken within 48 hours of the end of your quarantine. You should continue monitoring yourself for symptoms, and taking precautions like wearing a mask and social distancing.
 
But what are the benefits of quarantining for the full 14 days? The C.D.C. reminds us that “even if you test negative for Covid-19 or feel healthy,” you could still have the virus because symptoms could appear anywhere from two to 14 days following exposure.
 
Remember, while studies have found that the median incubation period of the virus is five days, and the vast majority of people develop symptoms within 11.5 days of being exposed, some patients show symptoms up to two weeks after being infected. So, if you do exit quarantine early, you may feel fine and still accidentally pass the virus along to Uncle Harold. 
 
Additionally, depending on when along that timeline you get tested, you could come up with a false negative — because the virus may not have yet sufficiently replicated in order to be detected. (Your test is more likely to be accurate in the early days after symptom onset, but drop again on the backend of the illness.)

567,"If I’ve been vaccinated, do I still need to wear a mask?","Yes, but not forever. The two vaccines that will potentially get authorized this month clearly protect people from getting sick with Covid-19. But the clinical trials that delivered these results were not designed to determine whether vaccinated people could still spread the coronavirus without developing symptoms. That remains a possibility. We know that people who are naturally infected by the coronavirus can spread it while they’re not experiencing any cough or other symptoms.
Researchers will be intensely studying this question as the vaccines roll out. In the meantime, even vaccinated people will need to think of themselves as possible spreaders.

568,There’s a case at my child’s school. Help?,"If we’ve learned anything from the first semester back in school, it’s that if your kid is in a classroom, you’ll most likely hear about some positive Covid-19 tests. But that doesn’t mean that schools will necessarily reshutter in response.
A case at your child’s school does not mean you should panic. Schoolchildren aren’t likely to get and spread the virus, so your kid is probably OK. A classroom in quarantine, or a school forced to switch to remote learning, does not necessarily mean a district has failed. In fact, if your school is following an established pandemic procedure, it may signal that things are working effectively — contact tracing is essential to help families and classrooms assess risks and make a plan.
As gut-wrenching as the news of Covid-19 in your school can seem, it’s better to catch a small number of cases before your school has an outbreak — so hearing about it could even be considered good news. And remember: If transmission rates in the surrounding community are high, students are most likely getting infected outside of school, where the environment is less controlled. 
“It’s important to distinguish between Covid in your school, which is bad, but not exactly the same thing as Covid being transmitted in your school,” said Dr. Benjamin Linas, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Boston University. “People have lives outside of school. It’s very likely that people will get infected somewhere else.”
Most experts agree that students shouldn’t return to school if more than 5 percent of people in their community test positive. In some places that number is even lower — at one point, New York had an infamously low threshold of 3 percent.

569,How can I deal with the loneliness?,"Being alone doesn’t have to be lonely — but it sure can feel that way. Rates of depression were already spiking this summer when the days were long and socially distanced outdoor activities were a given. Now, as we squirm against shorter days and tighter restrictions — both those imposed by local authorities as well as those reinforced by the weather — it is more important than ever to strike a balance between our physical and mental health. (Actually they go hand-in-hand: studies suggest that loneliness can adversely affect the immune system — making those people more likely to get sick.)
 
These days many of us feel caught between our closing walls and rabbit hole minds. So it’s especially important to take stock of your feelings, familiarize yourself with depression’s physical and mental markers and, if you’re uncertain, consider taking this self-diagnostic test. 
Andrew Solomon, a professor of medical clinical psychology at Columbia University Medical Center, explains that people’s responses to social isolation can be quartered into categories: 1. People who are generally unaffected, 2. Those with minor worry, 3. People now experiencing an anxiety disorder for the first time and 4. Those already suffering major depressive disorder but now falling into a “double depression.”
 
Ignoring depression can lead to substance abuse, broken relationships — and suicide. If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for a list of additional resources.
 
And remember: you’re not alone. Since the pandemic, one in three Americans have reported symptoms of an anxiety disorder — up from one in 12 last year. In June, Americans’ anxiety had tripled and depression had quadrupled between the first and second quarters of the year. Young adults and Black and Latino people (who have carried the brunt of the pandemic toll in loss of life and work) are experiencing upticks in anxiety, depression and thoughts of suicide, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost 11 percent of respondents noted suicidal thoughts, with those thoughts being most acutely felt by Black and Latino people, as well as essential workers and unpaid caregivers for adults. 
 
For those most greatly affected, professional help is suggested, but everyone can benefit from routine with time built-in for self-care. The things that brought you calm and joy in the months ahead of the pandemic may not make sense now, says Lucy Rimalower, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Los Angeles. So, be intentional in creating the schedule and self-care you need right now and let it change as your needs change.

570,"Why are some schools and universities remote only, while others are open for in-person learning?","Without clear federal mandates, state and local authorities have largely been on their own to determine the best course of action for their schools — and those plans differ greatly even under similar circumstances. (The same goes for colleges.) The result: a patchwork of unclear messaging and policies that has left many parents in the lurch.
It seems that access to the right resources and advance planning have given some schools a better shot at opening successfully. For that reason, across the country schools in lower-income neighborhoods are significantly more likely to opt for remote-only instruction. At the same time, some public schools are located in places with high community spread, so many of these districts made the tough decision to start and stay remote only.
In New York City and San Francisco, private school students are generally receiving live classroom experiences, while most public school students in both districts spent much of the school year without — meaning that the class divide is determining which children receive in-person instruction. 
More recently, some public schools that are reluctant to fully open have been pushing to at least get younger students back in front of a teacher — as research suggests that these children are in particular need of in-person instruction.
But no matter what kind of school your children attend, if they have been remote for the fall and are returning for the spring semester, be sure you know what to expect. 
At this point it should go without saying, but again: If your school has a “masks recommended” policy, rather than a masks required one, you’re at greater risk. And old ventilations systems with poor circulation can mean that the virus hangs around in one place that much longer.
Students in districts with low community spread will be safer.

571,Should my child take the bus?,"School buses are the nation’s largest single form of mass transportation. But during the coronavirus pandemic, the C.D.C. recommends they operate at reduced capacity to allow for social distancing.
Before putting your kid on the bus, be sure those guidelines are being followed. Among the C.D.C.’s suggestions: mandatory mask-wearing, opened windows, clearly marked six feet of space for kids lining up and unidirectional markers inside the bus to keep the flow of kids easy and uncongested. 
Disinfectants should be on board, but it never hurts to pop an extra hand sanitizer or pack of wipes in your child’s backpack. 
Similar to some of the outdoor dining situations you’ve seen, temporary dividers are also helpful on the bus — as well as leaving seats empty between people. (An easy reminder for kids: seats marked off-limits.) It’s also a good idea to keep some space away from the driver, who is more likely to contract the virus than many of the children on the bus.
But don’t be surprised if your bus driver isn’t wearing a mask. While the C.D.C. says mask-wearing should be encouraged, officials note: “Masks should not be worn by drivers and aides if their use creates a new risk (e.g., interference with driving or vision, contribution to heat-related illness) that exceeds their Covid-19 related benefits of slowing the spread of the virus.”
Of course, if you’re still worried and own a car, you can log some good quality time with the kids while driving them to school.

572,Is there help available to families without access to the internet?,"It is hard enough to learn through the Zoom classroom. But what about when you’re not even able to do that? 
The effects of a year of disrupted schooling on learning loss is yet unknown — but early indicators show that literacy among our young students could be horribly stunted.
As last school year wound to a close, a survey of more than 1,500 families around the country conducted by ParentsTogether, a national advocacy group, found a deep disparity between low-income parents and those making more than $100,000: lower-income students were 10 times more likely to be doing little to no remote learning. In other words: Many of these students weren’t receiving any formal education.
The reason for the disparity is simple: The digital divide is greatest in rural areas and communities of color, where families are sometimes without access to high-speed internet or are sharing devices for remote learning.
Poorer school districts put those families at a further disadvantage — unable to compete with richer districts quickly shelling out money for student devices. With worldwide demand for low-cost laptops up 41 percent from last year, shipments have been long-delayed — with poorer students in poorer districts last in line. Those students are now forced to watch recordings of classes or complete printed assignments delivered to their homes instead of attending the more interactive live classes. 
Among older students in less affluent families who are facing constrained economic situations at home, dropouts are on the rise, as children pick jobs over lackluster learning. 
If you’re in need of low-cost internet or affordable devices, reach out to your school. And then check out EveryoneOn, which pairs you with programs by your ZIP code. 
For those who want to help, you can donate to EveryoneOn or check out National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a nonprofit organization that urges the importance of internet access for all and has a list of local organizations working toward digital inclusion.

573,When can I return to normal life after being vaccinated?,"Life will return to normal only when society as a whole gains enough protection against the coronavirus. Once countries authorize a vaccine, they’ll only be able to vaccinate a few percent of their citizens at most in the first couple months. The unvaccinated majority will still remain vulnerable to getting infected.
A growing number of coronavirus vaccines are showing robust protection against becoming sick. But it’s also possible for people to spread the virus without even knowing they’re infected because they experience only mild symptoms or none at all. Scientists don’t yet know if the vaccines also block the transmission of the coronavirus.
So for the time being, even vaccinated people will need to wear masks, avoid indoor crowds, and so on.
Once enough people get vaccinated, it will become very difficult for the coronavirus to find vulnerable people to infect. Depending on how quickly we as a society achieve that goal, life might start approaching something like normal by the fall 2021.

574,What’s the deal with schools?,"The answer really depends on where you live: how bad the outbreak is in your geographic area and how strict local officials are being to keep the number of cases down. Some school districts have remained virtual, while others have fully reopened classrooms or have remained on a hybrid schedule. But across the country, the colder weather is starting to make it harder to keep students safe, as cases tick up and schools that have reopened shut back down.
In October, New York City, which had previously implemented a hybrid schedule, was the first big city to reopen all of its public schools — then quickly announced an immediate and indefinite shutdown in November. A few days later, however, the city announced a return to in-person education, and the tapering off of hybrid learning. (Do you have whiplash yet?) And the start to 2021 has caused only more uncertainty.
Currently, only younger students and those with complex disabilities — making up about 190,000 of the some 1.1 million of the city's public school students — are learning in the classroom, with a vast majority opting for remote learning. Middle and high school students, who were welcomed to the classroom for just a few weeks this fall, have no set date to return. It’s been hardly a promising effort for the nation’s largest school system, which has been criticized for lackluster remote learning, creating an ever-greater racial disparity within the school system — and one that school administrators across the country have turned to for an example of how to reopen safely.
This winter, more large cities have forged ahead, while others have remained remote. In Miami-Dade County and Houston all students through high school returned to the classroom in October. 
But after Covid-19 rates surged across California this fall, schools in several counties hit the brakes. The first students in Los Angeles began returning to the classroom in November, as schools serving kindergartners through second graders applied for county-approved health waivers to teach in areas with high infection rates. By the end of January, all students in San Diego are slated to return at least a few days a week. But San Francisco schools remain shuttered, with hopes of reopening in January dashed amidst high rates across the state. ""Right now we are in a surge that requires us to stay home and stop the spread,"" Mayor London Breed said in a statement in December. In an open letter published in January, 30 medical professionals from the University of California, San Francisco, urged the reopening of schools across the state by Feb. 1, writing: “Long term school closures have a detrimental, measurable impact on children and adolescents.”
As of mid-January, the vast majority of states — including New York — had handed off the decision-making for school openings to local districts, according to data pulled by Education Week, a news organization covering K-12. Only Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. (with some exceptions) have full closures in effect, while a handful of states — Delaware, North Carolina, West Virginia, New Mexico, California and Hawaii have partial closures, with hybrid instruction sometimes allowed. In contrast, four states — Texas, Florida, Arkansas and Iowa — require schools to offer at least some in-person instruction. (See Education Week's up-to-date map showing school openings by state.)

575,Will there be another stimulus payment?,"Another dose of relief was approved for the millions of Americans facing financial distress because of the coronavirus pandemic.
After months of back and forth, congressional leaders in both parties came to an agreement in December, providing a round of $600 stimulus payments to most Americans and partly restoring the enhanced federal unemployment benefit, offering $300 for 11 weeks. 
The legislative package provides welcome, albeit temporary, assistance to many, some of whom have already received stimulus checks and heartier and lengthened unemployment payments, but the package has also been criticized for being too little too late. President Biden promised additional aid, urging a third relief package. 
We’ve answered many of your questions about the current relief package, and will provide updates as the new presidential administration moves forward.

576,How is the winter weather affecting the virus?,"Cases have climbed rather steadily upward since November, which saw four million new cases in that month alone, climaxing Jan. 8 with almost 300,600 new cases that day and with winter dips in new cases still far above pre-November numbers. 
And those numbers don’t lie. Winter is a double-edged sword: We are moving indoors, increasing our risk among those around us, and the colder, less humid weather can increase the viral load of the air we’re breathing in. Covid-19’s fatty outer membrane becomes rubbery in cold weather — easing its transmission between people whose dry and winter-damaged nasal passages are more susceptible anyway. (Makes you want to throw on a mask, huh?)
“The nose and mouth are the virus’s portal of entry,” said Rossi A. Hassad, an epidemiologist and statistician at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. “How can a mask not be a barrier against an organism coming toward me?”
And just because this is the year of Covid-19, it doesn’t mean that winter’s stuffy friend, the flu, got the memo to stay away. As in other years, tens of thousands of people are expected to die from the flu this year. (A point of comparison: Covid-19 has a fatality rate at least 10 times that of the flu.)
What we know about the flu, which has that same rubbery membrane coat, can inform us about the dangers and precautions we should take against Covid-19. 
Comparing the two, Dr. Hassad wrote in MedPage Today: “This Covid-19 pandemic has the potential to parallel the 1918 flu pandemic if we fail to comply with the protective measures recommended by public health authorities.”
So far, more than 400,000 people have died in the U.S., with the country recording its first 100,000 deaths from the virus in late spring.
In addition to prime winter conditions for the virus, people across the country are also experiencing pandemic fatigue. Or as Dr. Stanley M. Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who has studied coronaviruses for more than 40 years, puts it, “People are losing respect for the virus and letting their guard down.”
Striking a balance between restrictions and mental health, while also keeping yourself and others out of harm’s way, is important. 
 
So what to do? If you are indoors, wear a mask, keep the recommended six feet distance from people outside your immediate household whenever possible, try to limit your time inside to places with good ventilation, open windows when you can and crank the heat, if necessary. Humidifiers are also strongly recommended.
But if you are socializing with others, it’s better to stay outside whenever possible. One suggestion from the British journalist Oliver Burkeman: Embrace your inner Brit and suck it up. An umbrella over the barbecue? (Not a problem, Mr. Burkeman said.) Eating ice cream in your fleeces? (Still yum.) And, remember, just because you’re socializing in the bad weather, doesn’t mean you can’t complain about the weather. (The Brits always do.)

578,Will it hurt? What are the side effects?,"The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine is delivered as a shot in the arm, like other typical vaccines. The injection won’t be any different from ones you’ve gotten before. Tens of thousands of people have already received the vaccines. 
While serious allergic reactions are rare, they have been documented. For instance, 10 minutes after receiving the Pfizer vaccine, a healthcare worker in Alaska had an anaphylactic reaction, and a rash crossed her face and torso. She also had shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate. And 10 minutes after the same vaccine, another healthcare worker in Alaska experienced eye puffiness, lightheadedness and a scratchy throat, but after medical treatment he was back to normal within an hour. Both workers, who were expected to recover, said they hoped their experiences did not negatively impact the vaccination process, according to the hospital. (The Pfizer vaccine was shown to be safe and about 95 percent effective in a clinical trial involving 44,000 participants.) In some places, people driving through for a shot in the arm have been asked to wait in the parking lot for 15 minutes to monitor for any immediate effects. 
More often, some people have felt short-lived discomfort, including aches and flu-like symptoms that last less than a day. It’s possible that people may need to plan to take a day off of work or school after the second injection.
While minor aches and pains aren’t pleasant, they are a good sign: They are the result of your immune system encountering the vaccine and mounting a potent response that will provide long-lasting immunity.

579,We have things to celebrate. What should we do?,"Even with a pandemic raging, there are things some have been lucky enough to celebrate. And you should: Life is short — you just don’t want to make it unnecessarily shorter. So how do you celebrate safely?
Infection rates have been on the rise as people began cozying up together indoors. In November, the month of Thanksgiving, the virus set new daily infection records: a million new cases reported in 10 days, another million in under seven days — a total of four million new cases over that month. And we similarly saw increases after the winter holidays — with a record 300,600 new cases Jan. 8 alone, just a week after New Year’s.
Some celebrations are worth delaying indefinitely. (Have you really turned a year older if it hasn’t been celebrated?) Others can be hosted over video chat. Or you can whittle down the party — masked up and distanced — to the people who matter the most.
And if you’re determined to gather, be sure to keep your guest list small. Experts advise limiting the number of households attending. (It’s best not to mix households at all.)
The recommended 10-day quarantine ahead of gathering — or even a shorter restriction of your contacts is better than nothing. Experts also suggest driving to the destination while limiting contact along the way, keeping your mask on and doing your best to keep some distance from those not in your household. You could throw a test on top for extra precaution — even for local gatherings. (See below for information about testing to determine the best test for you and when you should get it. And get more information from the C.D.C. about testing here.)
No matter the location or style of the event, everyone should wear masks as much as possible when not eating and people from different households should do their best to keep their distance. The recommendation is keeping six feet apart at all times.
The best safe-hosting option? Move the gathering outside. Outdoor gatherings are lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, according to Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester. (Go here for some tips on safe picnicking.)
If you must host indoors: The C.D.C. has prepared separate guidelines about how to properly clean your house before guests arrive, as well as how to be a pandemic-savvy host.
Before guests arrive, open the windows. That can increase the air exchange rate to as much as three times an hour — just half the rate recommended for buildings by the World Health Organization.
If it gets cold, you can crank the heater — in fact, the C.D.C. suggests putting your central air and heating on “continuous circulation.” Exhaust fans (like those over your stove or in the bathroom) can also help, but don’t turn on a regular fan — because that will simply recirculate the same, potentially contaminated air and increase everyone’s risk.
Other ways to lower the risk to you and your guests is to limit the length of your celebrations, keeping shouting and singing to a minimum, and limiting the sharing of serving bowls and utensils. And don’t bother getting out the nice guest towels. This year, paper towels are the way to go. The C.D.C. also reminds us to drink responsibly: “Use of alcohol or drugs may alter judgment and make it more difficult to practice Covid-19 safety measures.”
During the pandemic, being a good host means letting your guests know the expectations and safety standards up front — so no one is uncomfortable by unexpected rules or the lack there of — and have extra masks on hand in case a guest forgets.
 
But if you’re truly worried about getting Uncle Harold sick, stay home. It is the surest way to keep him safe.
 
And remember, no matter how far you traveled to gather: If you develop Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, etc.) within 14 days of celebrating or later test positive, make sure to let your host know and follow these guidelines to keep others safe.

How to Celebrate a Birthday Now",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
580,What should we do about birthdays?,"For those of us who enjoy getting older — or at least all the attention that comes with it, you can still observe the day while making sure you live to see another year. For those in milder climates, park birthdays (everyone masked and distanced) may still be an option. (For those in colder climates, a park party is a good way to see who will scarf-and-glove up for you — you know, the people who really love you.)
Otherwise, that virtual party over Zoom can actually be a lot of fun (I’m speaking from experience) — so long as you limit the time and plan simple, interactive ways to get everyone on the call to take part. Don’t pick a time too close to mealtimes — or you’ll lose people to their microwaves. Be respectful of not monopolizing people’s days. And if you’re inviting people from different time zones (after all, this is the year you can have anyone and everyone you’ve ever loved in one — albiet virtual — place), be sure you pick an hour that isn’t too late or too early for the guests.
If you’re like my mother and think eating birthday cake in front of everyone (without a slice) is rude, you can suggest they bring along their own favorite treats, so it feels like you’re all together. (Or just plough in, it is your birthday, after all.)
Think carefully about that invite list: Who knows who, what personalities work well together and what do folks who haven’t met have in common? The simple answer to that last question is: you. So, your next step is figuring out how this group of people can pass the time together, and, again, that should probably be centered on what they have in common — again, you. So ask folks to introduce themselves and (if you’re brave enough) share a funny or embarassing story about yourself. It’s a nice way to get people laughing, talking about someone they all know and (I assume) love, without it starting to sound like a eulogy. You can also end with a short game as a sign off — like a round-robin story where everyone contributes one sentence with their goodbye.
Just be sure to keep your guests’ tendencies in mind: If you’re inviting a bunch of talkers, you can let people speak up on their own (so long as they don’t scream over each other). If they’re a quieter bunch, you might want to call names – and regardless, that’s a nice way to get the party started. (You can even let a close friend or two know you’re going to start with them, so you can get rolling on a high note.) 
If everyone enjoys singing or another particular activity, you can incorporate that – but just be sure if you’re an opera star and inviting someone who is (um, well, not), you don’t make anyone feel uncomfortable. (You’ll know when people’s faces start blinking to darkened squares.) And speaking of appearances, just because you don’t have to clean the house, doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t make an effort with a nice, festive background – via real decorations or your own Zoom creation.
For kids (and more festive adults, too), you can also go for a multi-tiered birthday celebration: in-person activities at home with the members of your household, as well as online or drive-by activities with friends. At home, endow your birthday celebrant with “magic powers” for the day – the chance to pick each meal and all the family activities. (Get ready for a few more sweets and even more noise than usual.) 
Not sure how to fill time online with your kid’s friends? You could hire virtual entertainment. There are still music classes and magicians and clowns, and they offer virtual shows. (The website Mommy Poppins has a good list.) Or, if you don’t have the budget to hire a clown, you could always consider putting the red nose on yourself – and practice your juggling beforehand. (Unless you want the kids laughing at you.) Just be sure to keep any virtual party short and sweet – say one hour, with a start and end time. And to keep on schedule, signal that the call is wrapping up by introducing one final activity – phrases like “before we say goodbye,” or “we have just a few more minutes to do X” will cue that the party is coming to a close. (Both you and the other parents on the call will appreciate it.)
Or, if your kid feels like he’s at school every time he looks at his friends through a computer screen, consider taking the party to the street. Put a festive birthday sign replete with his favorite color balloons in the front yard and host a drive-by caravan, with celebrants waving, honking and throwing a requested candy from the window.

581,Does this affect how I should file my taxes this coming year?,"A few things to keep in mind when filing taxes for 2020:
For qualification purposes, you may report earnings from 2019 on the questions about earned-income tax credit as well as on the refundable portion of the child tax credit. (This may help you maintain eligibility if you lost your job or have had your work hours reduced.)
If you didn’t get one or both stimulus payments because of an income discrepancy that mistakenly disqualified you or because you are married to an undocumented immigrant, then you can retroactively claim it on your 2020 tax return, and it will come back as a refundable tax credit. (Learn how to claim the recovery rebate credit here.)
If you deferred making payroll tax payments the last few months, you will have to make them — but you have all of 2021 to do so. 
And remember, if you can, this is the year to give: Under the CARES Act, taxpayers can deduct up to $300 in cash without even itemizing your income tax return. And if $300 doesn’t seem like a lot, then go ahead and give it away — and take the tax deduction to boot!

582,Is it safe to go grocery shopping?,"We’ve all learned how to safely grocery shop during the pandemic — wear a mask, avoid crowds, keep the trip short and wash your hands (when you get home and after you’ve unpacked groceries). While it may feel like a more hazardous time to shop compared with earlier months of the pandemic, the level of risk varies across the country. Your risk of crossing paths with an infected person is higher when an indicator called the test positivity rate is above 5 percent in your community. 
Case counts and test positivity rates have risen across the country, which is why everyone needs to take precautions. But in some places, while precautions are needed and numbers have newly risen, it’s still not as bad as it once was. For instance, New York City’s test positivity rate now falls just below 9 percent, meaning your risk is lower compared with last April, when the rate was close to 70 percent. 
To find out how your state is doing, use this chart from Johns Hopkins University. And to find the test positivity rate in your community, check your state or county health department's website or try the Covid Act Now website.

583,"I didn’t qualify before, what about now?","Just because you didn’t qualify for unemployment benefits before doesn’t mean that you won’t qualify this time. 
For instance, if you previously received a mix of income from both self-employment and wages paid by other employers and are now unemployed, then you were most likely placed into a lower state-issued benefit bracket based on those lower wages. 
Let’s take Norma Jean, for example. She works as a waitress between freelance movie gigs. Her restaurant work qualifies her for the lower, state-level benefits while boxing her out of the more generous Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. 
The second stimulus package tries to fix her problem, sort of. So long as Norma Jean received at least $5,000 a year in self-employment income before the pandemic, she is now eligible for an additional weekly federal benefit of $100 — tacked on to the $300 extra everyone else is receiving. (Both add-ons end March 14.)
But again, nothing will be paid quickly. Norma Jean’s state will have to reach an agreement with the Labor Department before she starts receiving that extra $100 — and with states coming to these agreements at different times, a Norma Jean in one state may receive her extra Franklin before a Norma Jean in another.
And take note: You don’t have to have lost your job to collect benefits. If you are quarantined or furloughed without pay, even though you expect to return to your job, you can collect benefits in the interim.

While they’ll likely be reinstated automatically, you don’t want to leave that to chance, and you should expect to be waiting at least a few weeks before the money starts coming in.
Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst for social insurance at the National Employment Law Project explained that, historically, benefits are restored with the date of enactment, so what you’d be seeing is a gap in when you get paid, not a gap in your eligibility.

586,Are those outdoor winter dining contraptions really safe?,"In big cities such as New York and Chicago, tents, cabanas and wooden installations resembling large-scale dollhouses have been set up next to their mother restaurants lining the roads, taking up parking space.  Diners, some bundled in parkas and shivering into their matzo ball soup, have continued eating outside even as the weather turns wintery — but not all these outdoor shelters are the same. Just because you’re cold doesn't mean you’re really eating outside — or, most importantly, that you’re gaining the benefits of that al fresco meal with a reduced Covid-19 risk.  Outdoor dining has exploded in New York City — with more than 10 times the number of restaurants joining the city’s outdoor dining program than before the pandemic. (Governor Andrew Cuomo re-shut down New York City’s indoor dining Dec. 14 — with only outdoor dining, takeout and delivery now available.)  And while these restaurants are supposedly bound to winter dining rules, it’s unclear how strictly this will be enforced.   If you do want to eat at a restaurant and reduce your risk of contracting Covid-19, here’s what to look for:  *An open, airy space. In New York, any contraption with more than 50 percent of its wall area covered is considered inside dining. That’s a good general guideline for all of us. *Even outside, tables should still be six feet apart. And you should only be dining with members of your household. *Remain careful when eating near one of those outdoor heaters, as they are considered a fire hazard.

587,Help! I'm now both working and parenting from home. What should I do?,"Honestly, the first step is to acknowledge that this is totally bonkers. The writer Deb Perelman, who created the food blog Smitten Kitchen, laid it out plainly in her essay: ""In the Covid-19 Economy, You Can Have a Kid or a Job. You Can’t Have Both."" 
“Why are we not hearing a primal scream so deafening that no plodding policy can be implemented without addressing the people buried by it?"" she asks. 
But enough complaining. What to do? 
1. If you have a partner or another person or people who share the child-raising responsibilities, work with them to present a united front. Division will create disorder, which will create chaos, which will drive you all up the wall. (If you are going it alone, it's that much harder. With all you have to juggle, please accept our greatest admiration and proceed on to Step 2. At least there's *one thing* you don't have to worry about.)
2. Create boundaries. That might be a time boundary (“You are not allowed to talk to Daddy until 2 p.m. today"") or a physical boundary (“This is the adult room""). You can also make color-coded cards (green for ""go, red for ""don’t even think about it"") for the space dividers, which can signal when each of you can invade the other’s space. And remember, it may be going both ways — your kid could be sick of you, too (despite how perfect you are), so create boundaries for everyone in the family.
3. Also, there has never been a time when it was more important to use that precious time wisely. Think back to when you first had your child: sleep whenever you can and use noise-canceling technology, if needed. Having a daily schedule helps, too. (For more ideas about balancing work and school and creating effective schedules, skip down to the question ""How can I keep my kid on track?"")
4. Remember, now is not the time to beat yourself up about things not being perfect. We're in the midst of a pandemic: things aren't perfect. So, be kind to yourself, and to one another. If the kids are spending more time on their screens, or if you’re whipping up (okay, warming up) more chicken nuggets than super-healthy organic meals, that's OK, too. (The kids are probably thankful.) The most important thing is that you're together and loving one another through it.

588,What should I do to keep my home safe? Should I still be disinfecting everything?,"Always remember the basics, like washing your hands frequently (and lovingly reminding members of your household to do the same).
The coronavirus isn’t easily transmitted on surfaces. Or, at least, surfaces are a much lower risk than person-to-person transmission. So although disinfecting isn’t a bad idea (we are coming back around to spring cleaning season, after all) you probably don’t need to be quite as vigilant about that as we initially thought. 
You can keep your home safe by keeping people who might be infected out of it. (And since we don't know for sure who those people are, it's best to keep to the members of your household or pod.) 
And be sure to keep yourself safe when you’re outside of your home. That means wearing a mask and socially distancing whenever possible.

589,Flights to some tourist destinations are cheap. But is it ethical?,"Questions about the morality of traveling are not new. For years, people have raised concerns about climate change and traveling to countries with oppressive governments. Certain travel activities, like riding elephants, also raise eyebrows.
But with the temptation of cheap flights, the pandemic has put the morality of traveling in a whole new context. On the one hand, the economies of many vacation destinations often depend on tourism. Around the world, those in the industry have been similarly hit by travel restrictions, with workers now both worrying about their health if they go to work as well as how to continue supporting their families if they don't.
On the flip side, many countries have weak health systems, and traveling there could put the people who live there in grave danger. When cruisers were shut out of much of the Caribbean this spring and took safe harbor in the U.S. Virgin Islands, one of the only places to accept them, locals worried that their infinitesimal health care structure would be overwhelmed, as their case numbers began to creep up. 
As with everything these days, assess the risks and be extra careful about safety guidelines — and if you're American, be sure to check out the question above to make sure, before you book that trip, that you're even allowed inside the country once you get there.

590,"OK, I have a new job. How do I start it?","Congratulations! In ordinary circumstances, starting a new job is an act of showcasing both professional expertise and social prowess. But onboarding virtually, especially during a pandemic, can feel distant and impersonal. And you may feel a little weird — even guilty — that your initial relief and excitement in getting the job has been tainted by disconnect now that you have it.
Embrace the weirdness, if you can. Expect your new colleagues to see your bedroom or home office immediately, or maybe your partner or pet lurking in the background. That’s OK. They’ll be forgiving (we hope). And remember, you can still be social: Zoom coffees are totally kosher. 
Now that we've gotten that behind us, how do you prepare for the new job? Since you’ll be learning about your new role and your team through a computer screen, it’s important to give the technology you’ll be using a test run before your first day. Make sure you’re up-to-date on the company’s preferred communication tools, which may include Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams and other digital-collaboration products. (Just ask for a list upfront.) 
Also, ask your boss and co-workers directly how they like to communicate. ""You have to ask your boss, 'How do you want me to communicate with you? Do you want voice, phone, text, email and how often is good?'"" said Lisa Jacobson, a career consultant.
And if none of the above applies becuase you’re starting a new in-person job, prioritize safety conversations first. It’s good to know where the company stands with pandemic safety guidelines, and it’s respectful to ask detailed questions. It’s also easier to establish your boundaries ahead of time, rather than having to wedge them into conversation a few weeks down the line.

591,How can we keep grandkids connected to their grandparents?,"Older people are more likely to have a severe case of Covid-19, so visiting grandparents or grandchildren is risky. 
That being said, staying apart indefinitely is not feasible. Grandchildren are being born and passing other milestones, like hitting double-digits. Life is slipping by, so find a way forward. 
Social distancing is hard to explain to kids, and often harder to explain to grandparents. In the nice weather, you could spend time together outdoors. (And remember, we're taking precautions for the grandparents, but that doesn't mean that they get to forgo their masks, either: Everyone should mask-up.)
And in colder (or otherwise dispecable) weather, video chats also work, although you might need to walk your older parents through the twists and turns, so you don't get any close-ups of ears and noses.
If you live close, perhaps you conjoin your quarantine pods. Get tested, quarantine while you’re getting results back, and then spend time together normally. That might be your best option: Parents, stressed from working at home, desperately need reliable child care. (Some grandparents who have become the primary caregivers are delighted and, well, exhausted.)
But ultimately, it's not just about this year: you also want your kids to have their grandparents around at high school graduations, first jobs and weddings. If you can’t see each other safely, maybe you should wait until you can. (And be sure to remind the grandparents to get vaccinated. We're moving back toward normal, soon. Fingers crossed!)

593,How do I find a therapist?,"Finding the right therapist can be difficult, even under normal circumstances. And these certainly aren't those.
During the pandemic, people's anxiety and depression have shot up — and that includes young adults. If you're looking for someone to talk to, you're not alone.
For starters, therapy is different than counseling, both of which have merits. In many states, a ""therapist"" (providing therapy) is licensed, while a ""counselor"" is not. Our below recommendations are for therapists, although you should go with the person you're most comfortable talking to.
Therapy can be time-intensive and expensive. If you have insurance, figure out who is covered under your plan and narrow your choices from there. Regardless of insurance, if you are able to make it work, then consider following these steps:
1. Determine what type of professional help you need.
If you’re mostly looking to talk, a psychologist (someone who cannot prescribe medicaton) is a good bet.
But if you have a specific ailment — panic attacks, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, sociopathy, borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia — you should see a psychiatrist (someone who can prescribe medication) or a psychologist with considerable experience in that specialty.
2. Next, consider if you're ready to go into the therapist's office or if you'd prefer virtual therapy.
Video therapy is backed by peer-reviewed research and mirrors an in-person appointment, unlike text-based therapy services. In fact, teletherapy may be as effective as in-person therapy (and certainly has some advantages right now).
Therapists say it gives them a literal window into your home, which can make for more effective therapy, depending on the situation. And it's more convenient and sometimes less expensive than in-person consultations. Go to Psychology Today’s therapist finder to compare online and in-person therapy options where you live. As long as the therapist is licensed in your state, video appointments can expand your search beyond your immediate geographic area. (Of note: The selection of online therapists is still fairly limited, especially in some less-populous states.)
If you want to go the online route, we suggest searching for an online therapist with Amwell. (We're not making this suggestion lightly: Our reporters researched five platforms for more than 70 hours, going to appointments with each over a two-year period.) The service is private, secure, accredited and accepts insurance. It also offers more therapists than the competition — increasing your chances of finding someone who fits your schedule and needs.
Plus, you know how annoying it is when you're video-calling someone and then your eyes wander to that little square with your face in it? (Is that a hair out of place? Do I really look like that? What am I doing with my hands? Wait, what were we talking about, again?) Well, with Amwell you can hide yourself, making your session feel a bit more like a real-life conversation.
Other teletherapy services include MDLive and Doctor on Demand, among others. You might also consider these newish mental health startups, which also provide virtual services, among them: Real Therapy, Cerebral. (Of note: since the pandemic, Medicare has changed its policies to cover most telehealth, and the same goes for many private insurance companies.)
Some people are even finding connection through TikTok, where therapists sometimes post in their PJ's and the usual walls are down. The burgeoning of mental health content has come when more and more people are feeling down and seeking connection. Of course, the 60-second video platform should not be the end of your therapy search, but it might be a toe in.
Now, if you're in a home situation where you can't safely talk, you could consider counseling or therapy services through texting apps like BetterHelp and Talkspace, both of which have seen an uptick in users since the start of the pandemic. While this does not provide the same interpersonal connection, depending on your circumstances it may be the safest bet. The most important thing is to reach out for help. (Also check out our question: ""I’m worried that I, or my friend, might be suffering domestic abuse. What should I do?"" for more information about what to do to get out of a bad situation. We've including help numbers and chat lines, too.)
3. Then, set up a few preliminary calls and consultations. The getting-to-know-you session is often free, and you should take it as an opportunity to talk about what you are looking for from therapy, and learn how each therapist approaches their practice.
4. Whether online or in person, you might click with someone the same way you would with a new friend. And there’s nothing wrong with trying a few initial appointments to learn about your own wants and desires.

594,Should I get a regular flu shot?,"Yes. Let's avoid a “twindemic,"" please. While we've largely managed so far, we're not yet in the clear.
Dr. Rossi A. Hassad wrote in MedPage Today that the Covid-19 pandemic could mirror the influenza pandemic of 1918 if we ignore public health measures. 
As in other years, tens of thousands of people are expected to die from the flu this go-round. (The C.D.C. keeps this interactive map updated with reported flu infections across the country.)
What we know about the flu, which has a rubbery membrane coat similar to that of Covid-19, can inform us about the dangers and precautions we should take against the virus — because although there are differences between the flu and the coronavirus, both illnesses can produce similar symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue that can be extreme. 
Translation: while we should always get our annual flu shot, this year it's more important than ever. The worrisome flu strains change every year, and the influenza vaccine is safe and effective — so why not? And depending on where you live, it may be pretty easy to get a flu shot: Some places, like certain NYC Health + Hospitals locations in the city, provide free flu shots along with free coronavirus tests — no insurance necessary.
And for those sniffly doubters who claim to still get the flu after the shot anyway — while you're blowing your nose, keep in mind that the illness is likely to be significantly less severe than it would have been without the vaccine. (As for those who feel icky for just a day or two after injection, that's actually a good sign. Your antibodies are kicking in!)

596,What about getting a haircut?,"You could, if only for the story, do it yourself. A buzz cut is … possible, although perhaps ill-advised. And that beard you've been carefully cultivating? Chances are it’s time you rethink that unkempt look. (Doubtful? Just ask your partner, trusted friend, or that reflection in the mirror. They're not lying.)
Fixing our hair is a rich and beloved form of self-care. Even when you’re visible only on Zoom, split ends and straggly edges can crimp your confidence. When barbershops reopened in New York City, people came rushing back.
In fact, even before barbershops could reopen there, Herman James, a barber in Manhattan, set up his shop under a leaf-laced pergola in Central Park, offering free haircuts to anyone who passed by. (Tips are appreciated.) So for those not yet ready to enter a salon but very ready to have their hair cut, make an appointment with the Central Park Barber, who as of late January could still be spotted on warmer days cutting hair by the lake just north of Strawberry Fields. (Wintry weather may affect appointment times.) He wears a mask and has a chair waiting for you.
And if you opt for a salon, make sure that both you and the person doing your hair are wearing masks. They have to get close to you, so be extra careful. Also, unless you’re getting your hair done outside, make sure the windows are open and there is good ventilation, to keep air moving through the space.
To keep yourself safe, shampoo your hair at home, so your stylist doesn’t have to bend over you. Wait for the appointment outside and keep the appointment short. (Yep, skip the blowdry.) And if you're getting your hair colored, step outside while the chemicals are taking, and wash your own hair out. As for those going in for a shave — go for a not-so-close shave, or unloop one ear at a time, holding your mask to your face. Safety first. Vanity second.

597,How about gyms?,"You can apply the stereotypes of sweaty locker rooms to your local gym. (After all, why are the locker rooms so gross in the first place?) By their very nature, athletic facilities like gyms tend to be infested with germs, and gym equipment can be difficult to sanitize. In a study published last year, researchers found drug-resistant bacteria, flu virus and other pathogens on about a quarter of the surfaces they tested in four different athletic training facilities. (When cleaned the right way, germs in gyms can fall almost to nil — but that assumes everyone is following the rules and doesn't take into consideration other health risks beyond the equipment.)
When weighing whether to head back to your gym, remember it's a confined space, and exercising with a mask on is hard. If you think you can manage, be sure to check the health and safety policies in place at your gym before heading over. You can also take additional measures to keep both you and those around you even safer. Clean any grime or dust from surfaces, then disinfect anything you touch. When spraying a disinfectant, give it a few minutes to kill the germs before wiping down the equipment. Once you've finished using a machine, disinfect it again for the next person. And be sure to wash your hands frequently, or use hand sanitizer.
After a five-month closure, gyms in New York reopened in August — to a long list of regulations, including a required health screening ahead of check-in, mandatory mask usage during workouts, and lots and lots of cleaning. (Occupancy is limited to one-third of total capacity.)
If all of this talk about pathogen-covered equipment is giving you the creepy crawlies, consider a safer alternative: exercising outside. Even in the dead of winter, many New Yorkers can still be spotted bundled, masked and jogging around Central Park. Your risk of infection is lessened and on sunny days, you get the added benefit of Vitamin D — an essential immune system-strengthener that helps combat the cold and flu. 
But if you just can't brave the cold, you can also stream online exercise classes from home. (One gym in Long Island, N.Y., created a new type of fitness community called Life Outside the Box, lending its equipment to members to use in their homes and offering virtual fitness coaching. And there are many other personalized workouts you can purchase, as well.) A cheaper option? Set up a corner of your home and lay out a yoga mat. Either way, you're making the world safer, and if you forgo the personal trainer, you're saving on gym fees, too.

598,What do we do about our wedding?,"Are you dreading the impending date of the day you have always dreamed about? The pandemic has ruined a lot — and has really taken a toll on weddings. Depending on cancellation fees, you may choose to postpone. (Lots of people are.) And if you want to be sure that you can celebrate in person with everyone you love, be flexible about choosing a new date — you wouldn’t want to have to re-cancel. For those who can’t afford to postpone, you can create a virtual component to the wedding, so that everyone can “be” there without actually being there. (But keep reading for the right way to do that — because while manners are changing with the pandemic, they aren’t null and void.)
For the newly engaged: Enjoy the moment — if you do it right, you’ll be engaged only once. In the interim, start talking with your partner about what you’d like for the big day, and plan slowly. With people getting vaccinated, we will soon be able to start making plans like normal. But the process could be slow. No need to rush the wedding, just to postpone later. Besides, if you plan it too soon, you might lose out on your bachelor/ bachelorette party — and those will be far more fun in the near but undated future. (And remember, if you're in a holding pattern for the big day, data suggests that you're doing it right: the later you get married, the more likely you are to stay married; adding years of courtship ahead of the big day incrementally decreases your risk of filing for divorce later.)
As for changing plans, long-held wedding decorum may no longer be applicable, especially when it comes to uninviting guests. To avoid having to retract invitations, Steve Moore, an owner of Sinclair and Moore Events in Seattle, says couples should either skip the save-the-date cards or include a disclaimer noting they plan to adhere to state and federal guidelines for gatherings. “We’ll ask in advance for your flexibility, understanding and grace,” he offered as a suggestion on what to write. Just don’t send a plethora of fake invitations, complete with parking information, just to recant later in a Facebook post with a link to your registry. 
And in some places, like New York, the one-time epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, large marriage ceremonies will be allowed starting March 15 — with strict measures in place, of course. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo plans to release guidance about how such events can go forward, and any such weddings will additionally need to be approved by local health departments. Up to 150 guests could attend — with proof of negative test results, and venues would be capped at 50 percent (or, again, up to 150 people).
No matter what, be sure you are clear when communicating with your guests about any changes. A simple online blast, while effective, may not be sufficient. (You don’t want a guest showing up just because she has the good sense to detox from social media.) Depending on the size of the guest list, you can call, or send a text or an email — or depending on the timing and nature of the changed plans, you can send a “you are cordially uninvited to my wedding” card. (A disappointed selfie of the couple could at least bring a few laughs along with the dis-invite.) But soon-to-be-married couples: make sure to emphasize that the change in plans is not because you don’t love the person but because you do. And you can always tack on the promise of a second “to be determined” invitation. After all, with the stress you’ve been under, your first or second wedding anniversary might just call for a big party — when you can host without all of the pressure. (Paper and cotton gifts may not cut it in a post-pandemic world.) 
And if you really don’t want to cancel, you could try to host a wedding over Zoom at the planned location or somewhere else — or switch it up to a drive-in theater). Or, just invite the people closest to you (that’s often both immediate families and best friends, not all of your sorority sisters — unless you really are that person) to celebrate face-to-face, making sure they all get tested before you gather. (“Please bring a gift and proof of Covid test.”) #Covidwedding has 336,000 Instagram posts and counting.

599,What should I consider when choosing a mask?,"Masks are still necessary — and even more so with several variants of the virus emerging. (In fact, nowadays, you should consider a mask with an extra filter sandwiched between two pieces of cloth or at least doubling-up on masks.)
There's no one-mask fits all, however: the size of your head and other facial features, as well as your environment and what you plan to do while wearing your mask (walk down the street, work a full day in construction) is going to change what you're looking for. (And there are a lot of stylish options, as well as N-95s and other medical masks. You can even make them yourself — just be sure you consider the best material to use.) 
But after extensive research, along with fit and comfort testing, we are recommending a few adjustable cloth masks that fit most people. And be sure to also check out our recommendations for children's masks  — they're even kid-approved. (That's right they were tested by a panel of children ages 3 to 10.) Just remember, like with all clothing and accessories, it needs to be something you'll actually wear — and wear properly. After all, you should be wearing it whenever you leave the house — even if you have already been vaccinated. (We don't yet know if vaccinated people can still spread the virus.)
And, of course, no matter what mask you chose, be sure to: 
-Wash your hands before and after wearing your mask, and pull it off by the loops or ties (don't pull from the cloth front).
-Be sure you're putting it on before you leave home (for those in apartments, that means wearing it in communal hallways, stairwells and elevators) and taking it off when you're back inside.
-Keep your reusable mask in a clean, dry place and clean it frequently. (Here's a guide for how to clean your mask.
-Remember, your mask is only one part of your safety plan. Again, wash your hands often and keep to social distancing measures. (That's six feet apart.)
By now, it should go without saying, but apparently — for Bill Clinton who has famously worn it tucked under his nose and simple drawings to guide you — and be sure your mask covers your face from nose to chin, doesn't gape at the edges and can be worn for an extended period of time without being pulled down. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said it best: no chin-guards, please.

Why We Wear Masks",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
600,Why is it safer to spend time together outside?,"By now, we know that Covid-19 is an airborne illness, with tiny droplets of the virus staying in the stagnant air for hours after an infected person has been there. Moreover, Covid-19’s fatty outer membrane becomes rubbery in cold weather — easing its transmission between people whose dry and winter-damaged nasal passages are more susceptible anyway. 
There are some risk factors you can't mitigate for (the weather, for instance), but others you can (like choosing to socialize indoors or outside). Your risk of contracting the virus increases when you're inside poorly ventilated and enclosed indoor spaces, where the contaminated air is recycled. 
And outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester. 
And it's all about virus load — in fact even just a light wind will quickly scatter the virus, so that people nearby will be potentially exposed in far smaller, less harmful quantities. “A single virus will not make anyone sick,"" said Eugene Chudnovsky, a physicist at Lehman College at the Graduate Center the City University of New York. ""It will be immediately destroyed by the immune system. The belief is that one needs a few hundred to a few thousand of SARS-CoV-2 viruses to overwhelm the immune response.”
So, when in doubt, go outside and stay outside as much as possible when interacting with people not in your immediate household. And no matter what, be sure you're wearing a mask.
We know it's cold, but if you layer-up and keep moving, your body will actually acclimate pretty quickly. Pro tip: wear three layers, something wickable underneath to limit sweat, followed by fleece and finally a wind- and rain-repellant coat. Also, heed your grandmother's nagging: Be sure to cover your hands (mittens are warmer than gloves), feet (double up on socks, if you can — just don't cut off circulation when squeezing into your shoes) and head (a hat will keep as much as 10 percent of your body heat from escaping). Also, don't blow into your hands if you're cold — the moisture will end up making you feel colder. (Again, you should be wearing a mask anyway.)
 
If you must be indoors with people outside of your pod, then at least open the windows. That can increase the air exchange rate to as much as three times an hour — just half the rate recommended for buildings by the World Health Organization. And if it gets cold, you can crank the heater — in fact, the C.D.C. suggests putting your central air and heating on “continuous circulation.” Exhaust fans (like those over your stove or in the bathroom) can also help, but don’t turn on a regular fan — because that will simply recirculate the same, potentially contaminated air and increase everyone’s risk.

601,What are superspreaders?,"A superspreader is someone who is incredibly infectious, passing the virus on to a disproportionate number of other people. 
The good news is: They’re rare. The bad news is: they're hiding among us. And no one (even the superspreaders themselves) knows who they are. Sound like a horror movie? (Yeah, we've gotten that a lot lately.)
There was that Texas birthday party, where one man reportedly infected 17 members of his family. Plus those Biogen employees, who are believed to have infected as many as 300,000 people after a healthcare conference at the Boston Marriott Long Wharf Hotel in February 2020. And who can forget that notorious Connecticut soirée, dubbed “Party Zero""?
Of course, superspreading isn't a new concept. Ever heard of Typhoid Mary? Yep, the cook was asymptomatic but still spread the disease to more than 50 people. Superspreading has also caused outbreaks of tuberculosis, measles, Ebola, SARS and MERS.
And like other diseases, superspreading events have helped drive the coronavirus pandemic. Determining who the superspreaders are and when and where the superspreading takes place is an important part of trying to limit outbreaks. (On the other hand, there are people unknown, evidence suggests that circumstances are likely to blame as opposed to biological differences between people.
Toward the beginning of the pandemic, Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, tried to determine what's called the ""dispersion parameter,"" or the measure of variation from person to person in transmitting Covid-19. He compared cases in different countries. You’d expect the outbreaks in different places to be mostly the same size if Covid-19 was like the flu. But it's not. Instead, Dr. Kucharski and his colleagues found a wide variation: 10 percent of infected people were responsible for 80 percent of new infections — meaning most people passed the virus on to few, if any, others. He published his findings in a preprint, which had not been reviewed by other scientists or published in a scientific journal, but other epidemiologists wound up with similar estimates.
Superspreaders provide a lesson in societal interconnectivity, said Dr. Jacob E. Lemieux, an infectious-disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital and a researcher at the Broad Institute, who looked at the superspreading case at the Boston conference. From there, the virus spread to at least 29 states, Australia, Sweden and Slovakia — as well as Boston homeless shelters, where it had a devastating effect. “Our intuition about how disconnected we can be is not reliable,"" Dr. Lemieux said. ""We are so connected that we don’t appreciate the linkages and interactions we have.”
So what can we do? Since you don't know if you or someone else you know could be a superspreader, it's important to be socially responsible: avoid crowds, wear a mask and social distance. And, please, don't host a soirée anytime soon.

602,I want to help other families with school-age kids. How?,"This is still a hard time for all of us — but some more than others. And if you're in a position to help, an increasing number of people are in need of it. You can offer a helping hand, either through donations or volunteering. 
If you have children, involve them by asking their opinions on where they think you should focus your resources. They can also help raise money by hosting a socially distant bake sale or starting an online fund-raising campaign. And if you can afford it, a recurring monthly commitment — set up with an automatic withdrawal from your bank account or credit card — makes it easy for your family to commit for the long run. (Charity Navigator has a list of vetted nonprofit organizations that are working in communities affected by the outbreak.)
One place of particular need could be at your local school. We could have a generation of children teaching themselves and falling further behind — because some students still don't have access to the basic materials they need (laptops, a stable internet connection) to learn remotely.
You may consider giving to EveryoneOn, which provides families with programs for low-cost internet or access to affordable devices, or National Digital Inclusion Alliance, a nonprofit organization that urges the importance of internet access for all and has a list of local organizations working toward digital inclusion. Also, Comp-U-Dopt refurbishes used computers and gives them to children in cities across the country. For $215, the organization can obtain a computer, overhaul it, deliver it and provide two years of tech support and training. And for school supplies, you may donate to First Book, a national nonprofit that provides free or inexpensive books and learning materials to children who need them.
Finally, we could all use more positive people in our lives right now — from a distance, of course. One organization in New York, the New Neighbors Partnership, connects refugee families with those who have slightly older kids. You can mail your clothing donations directly to the family or hand-deliver them (accompanied by staff). You never know, a relationship starting with a few hand-me-downs could lead to a continuing connection with another family for years to come.

603,What should I do about restaurants?,"Maybe a few of us have discovered our inner-callings as nightly chefs. But most of us miss going out to eat.
Restaurants have been especially hard hit: 87 percent of New York City’s restaurants and bars couldn’t pay their full rent in August, and the cold weather is keeping more and more diners away even from ellaborate outside dining contraptions. 
In part an economic decision, New York City restaurants reopen to indoor diners in time for Valentine's Day, with indoor capacity capped at 25 percent, starting Feb. 12. (Outside the five boroughs, indoor dining is easier — at 50 percent capacity.)
The restaurant industry has taken a hard hit across the country — even restaurants in states allowing limited inside dining. California has lost almost 40,000 restaurants since last year — recording more restaurant closures than anywhere else in the country, according to recent Yelp figures.
But remember, as much as we're ready to head back out to eat, while spending money at local businesses is a great way to help the economy, just because a restaurant is open doesn’t mean that that restaurant is safe either for you, or for other customers and staff. The rules with outdoor dining are fuzzy: many people take their masks off when they sit down to dinner and don’t put them back on until they’ve paid the bill. That could endanger you and those around you, as well as the staff who have to bend over guests to serve them. Let’s also consider that you may not only be going out to dinner with people in your household or pod — and tables aren’t usually large enough to keep six feet of distance between you and those you're dining with. (And, of course, those same concerns only mount if you're able to and considering eating inside the actual restaurant.)
Some open restaurants have also been linked to viral spread. The food itself is not the problem. Rather, it’s customers whose laughter and talking can spew viral droplets throughout the area and all over other diners and staff.
Of course, you can always order takeout. Or, if you're tired of delivered dishes that just aren't as good as they usually taste inside the restaurant, you could try a ghost kitchen — restaurant food specifically designed for takeout. That way you can support local businesses and avoid the kitchen — without so many ethical and safety concerns.

If an empty elevator opens and others are waiting, you can always offer that they go ahead (if you have time), or politely ask that they take the next elevator. (Just be careful of tone, no need to offend anyone while staying safe.)
Even if you are alone in the elevator, since droplets can hang in the air long after you leave, wear your mask at all times. 
And whether with others or alone: no talking (even on the phone or to yourself). Keeping your mouth shut lowers the risk of you spewing coronavirus droplets into the contained space.

605,Why are bars linked to outbreaks?,"So a virus walks into a bar ... it sounds like the start to a bad joke, but, sadly it is no joke. 
This summer, as people began once again flocking to restaurants and bars, some of those places became breeding grounds for outbreaks. And such outbreaks continued into the fall. As a result, we're still seeing restrictions into the winter, although in places like New York City that have had stringent rules, those restrictions are beginning to loosen ever so slightly.
To understand the connection between bars and outbreaks, consider a simple question: Are you your most vigilant self after a few drinks? A bar is an intimate environment, where alcohol is flowing, inhibitions are down and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend (or that cute stranger that just came up to you). But feeling good and close to strangers is so a thing of 2019 — to be revisited only when we've all been vaccinated or are at least enjoying the perks of herd immunity.
For now, when we're doing our best to keep our distance — even from our friends and loved ones — the very point of a bar setting is rindered null and void. Bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials tied at least 100 new coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota traced at least 328 cases to bars across the state. And in Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. 
So for now, cozy up with people in your pod or household (or jump on Zoom) and pour yourself a glass of your favorite libation. It's safer (and so much cheaper, too).

Although driving restrictions aren't generally as tight as they were in the early months of the pandemic, the day before you go, you should still check restrictions (no matter your method of travel). And it may be less stressful to just stay close to home for now.
But that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun. You could buy or rent a van or a boat. (Both industries are booming.) Or go on a solitary hike in the country. Some national parks may be crowded, but you could take a road trip to an alternative destination. Nature can be healing, especially these days.

607,I’m having trouble sleeping. Any tips?,"Seems like it's getting harder and harder to fall asleep and stay asleep these days. And while there's no catch-all fix to getting good night's sleep, staying on a consistent schedule is certainly a good start to improving your sleep. (That means sticking to a regular wake and bedtime, and setting up a relaxing pre-sleep routine that helps you wind down before you even get under the covers.)
Not to give you something else to contemplate when you should be counting sheep, but sleeping seven hours a night is linked to a healthier, longer life. (Eight hours a night is the magic number that most adults need.) And sleeping less than that is associated with a nightmarish assortment of problems: obesity, heart disease, depression and impaired immune function, among others. (And we could all use a high-functioning immune system right about now.)
In fact one study links a decrease in sleep to an uptick in your risk of getting sick and without sleep you're curbing your body's abilty to produce cytokine, a protein boosting your immune system's response to antigens. Even less than a week of really bad sleep, one study found, can cut a healthy young person's typical number of antibodies to a flu vaccine in half.
We all come with a 24-hour internal clock that keeps us in time with the earth, but genetics, age and our personal habits throw that timer off. If you're not sure where you fall on the spectrum of lark to night owl, take this sleep quiz. 
And keeping a simple sleep log for one week (here's our sleep diary worksheet) can help you determine any issues with sleep:
1. Note the time you go to bed and the time you wake up.
2. Now do the math: how many hours did you get?
3. Are you waking up in the middle of the night? Also note any mid-day siestas.
4. In the morning ask yourself: Am I tired? (Hint: If you're falling asleep throughout the day, or longing to curl up for a nap, then the answer is: ""Yes."") And if you're getting that seven to eight hours and you're still answering ""Yes,"" then it may be about the quality, not the quantity, of sleep you're getting; you could be experiencing interrupted sleep or a sleep disorder, so talk with a doctor or undergo a sleep study, so you can take advantage of those sacred hours of shut-eye. 
To reset that internal clock, start with a goal: When do you want to wake up each morning? (And be honest, how does that compare to when you're actually waking up?) Begin waking up 20 minutes earlier each day, inching toward that goal wakeup time. (Hopefully, of course, you'll also be getting to bed 20 minutes earlier each night, too.) And whatever you do, don't mix it up on the weekends. It should go without saying, but: go to bed when you're sleepy — your body wants to get back on rythm, so let it.
And if you want to avoid those hours tossing and turning after your head hits the pillow, consider incorporating some or all of the below:
Before Bed:
-Nix that late cup of coffee (obviously). Also, alcohol (which leads to fragmented sleep), as well as any food (no need for the heartburn or the extra inches around the waist).
-Cut the screentime 90 minutes before bed. (That means no emails, social media or TV.) Might we instead suggest some more soothing options: take a bath or read a book. And if you're still doubtful of your willpower, start small with 15 minutes away from the screen and continue cutting back. 
-Make a list of what you need to do the next day and then let it leave your mind. It's written down — for tomorrow.
-Your bedroom should be a place of rest. Don't leave out unfinished work, exercise equipment or other stress-inducing reminders from the day. (And yep, that includes television and other news media.)
-Sleeping pills could help, but you may want to talk to a doctor first. One option could be melatonin supplements. But be sure to read the pill bottle for what you can and can't take with any medication. (Sleeping medication might be another good reason to cut down on the alcohol: you shouldn't be mixing it with melatonin supplements, for instance.) Better yet, try these drugless alternatives.
-If you have a hard time waking up, then leave the blinds open so the natural light will stream into your room in the morning, gently nudging you to consciousness. (And if you have a work shift that requires you to work nights, consider investing in blackout curtains.)
In the morning: 
-Get up with your alarm clock — and don't even think about hitting snooze. (Pro tip: if you're not waking up to your alarm clock, then buy a louder one or switch up the ring tone.) 
-Head outside for at least 15 minutes of sunlight early in the day. The sun nudges you awake and has other positive effects for the mind and body.
-Yep, actually eat breakfast. Not only is it good for your metabolism, but it also gets you into a good grove from the start. 
-Get moving earlier in the day: Working out (a socially distanced walk or at-home routine) uses up that nervous energy and tires you out by the end of the day. Just be sure not to get your blood flowing too close to bedtime, or you'll be wide-eyed (and sweaty).
-To the extent possible, throughout the day try to keep to a routine: eating around the same time and winding down, too.
-If you need a nap, take it between 1 and 3 p.m. But don't let the nap become your sleeping problem. Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist who studies the connection between behavior and sleep, recommends keeping it short: 10 to 20 minutes should do it. (Yep, your cat really has been doing it right all along.)

608,How can I stay motivated with everything going on?,"As the months mount to a year, the ennui of coronavirus-induced isolation can undermine our enthusiasm for getting anything done. (Or maybe ""enthusiasm"" is a misplaced word: It's been a real slog, over here.)
If that sounds familiar, remember: Doing what’s meaningful — acting on what really matters to a person — is the antidote to burnout.
Motivation might best be fostered by dividing large goals into smaller ones (specific tasks that are more easily accomplished), but not so simple that they are boring and soon abandoned. Avoid perfectionism — the ultimate goal could become an insurmountable challenge. (Do it the best you can, then move on — leaving room and energy to do it even better next time.) As each task is completed, reward yourself with something fun (maybe calling a friend, trying a new recipe, organizing your closet — whatever gives you joy) and then go on to the next one.

How to Maintain Motivation in a Pandemic",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
609,Help! I’m frustrated with my partner.,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single person a year into the pandemic must be in want of a partner ... and that a couple one year in must be in want of, well, a little more alone time.
In some cases, the pandemic has fast-tracked relationships, and couples who have known each other for only a short time find themselves cohabitating or even heading down the aisle. In other cases, couples break up, and divorce rates are rising in some places. What this all reminds us is that relationships, too, relationships, too, must live or die by the pandemic.
If you’re cohabitating, you could be in a tough spot. If you’re not, while your situation could not be more different, you may similarly find yourself with difficult decisions to make: you’ve probably had to figure out ways to see each other — or not — that feel safe and nurturing for both of you, as well as those in your inner-circles. 
Or as Eric Spiegelman, a podcasting executive in Los Angeles, tweeted in April, “My wife and I play this fun game during quarantine, it’s called ‘Why Are You Doing It That Way?’ and there are no winners."" (It got over 400,000 likes and some 47,000 retweets. Apparently, a lot of us have been playing that game.)
""The traditional marriage vows are 'for better or for worse,'"" said Jean Fitzpatrick, a relationship therapist in Manhattan. “This is for worse. And so, how do we navigate a time like this? Our relationships will either grow as a result, or they will be harmed.""
Long before the pandemic, one married couple tied themselves together with a 15-foot string for a whole day and wrote about their experience for Slate. “We don’t have any stories to tell each other about our day because we lived the same day,” David Plotz, the husband in the article, wrote. “We don’t have questions for each other because we know the answers. We can’t lie and exaggerate and twist the day’s happenings to gain sympathy — the usual evening activity for most married couples, I suspect — because the other will call foul.” Sound familiar?
If it's too late and your partner is already out the door or you've been single throughout the pandemic and are now looking for a new match, consider skipping down to the question ""How do I date during this time?"" For others, whether you're too far apart or too close together right now, you may be missing your partner. Vanessa Marin, a relationship and sex therapist, has written several columns about maintaining your relationship. We've compiled some of her advice (and advice from others) to help your relationship survive the pandemic:
1. Take care of yourself first. (And, no, that's not a selfish No. 1.) Being a better you will make you happier, as well as your significant other, because, newsflash: taking care of you is not the sole job of your partner. Right now, it's more important than ever to ""feel your feelings,"" writes Ms. Marin, adding that validating your emotions will help you move on more quickly. To get in touch with yourself, try meditating, journaling free form for five or 10 minutes a day and exercizing. Also, be sure to reach out to others beyond your partner. Remember those friends you used to get together with before the pandemic squeezed the normality out of life? Reach out to friends and family to see how they're doing and share what's going on in your own life, too. (Pro tip: If you're getting almost all of your social and emotional support from one person, you're not doing it right. It's not fair to expect or possible to deliver on taking care of each other's every need. Bottom line: It's just not healthy and you're building a foundation for certain disappointment.)
2. If you live with others, consider the safety of everyone in your households and openly communicate with them to determine individual comfort levels before bringing your significant other back to that shared space. Then be sure to check-in frequently: With passing time and new strains of the virus cropping up, those comfort levels may be changing, and what people were good with in the summer could be very different from what they're OK with now. 
3. Make (and stick to) a plan. Discuss what each of you have to tackle (both longterm and over the course of the next week or so). Check in at an appointed time each week to recallibrate and nightly to tweak the day ahead. Right now, the pandemic has put only added pressure to a persistent disparity in the distribution of parental labor, with women carrying the brunt of added child care responsibilies (as well as disproportionate job loss) even beyond their majority share before the pandemic. That unequal division of parenting and household responsibilities, along with financial problems, and just too much arguing are among the top reasons couples separate or file for divorce, studies show. So be sure to divide the responsibilities, and if you're the kind of couple that gets joy (or at least a bit of peace) from a shared calendar, then go for it.
4. Yep, you should still be checking in on each other. Whether you're living in different timezones or literally sitting next to your partner all day, every day, be sure to remember: “It’s not about grand gestures, it’s about doing small things often,"" says Logan Ury, the director of relationship science at the dating app Hinge. (And that goes for asking about the little things, too.) Some of us are experiencing “ambiguous loss,” said Sinead Smyth, a licensed marriage and family therapist, adding that some of us may not want to complain to our partners about these frustrations, but if you don’t honestly share these feelings, you may start to lean away from each other, when you should be leaning closer. (At least metaphorically speaking.) 
It might seem simple or even over-redundant, but you should still be asking the questions you (hopefully) were asking pre-pandemic: ""How was your day?"" ""How are you feeling?"" (Or, ""I notice you seem [insert emotion here], what's going on?"") ""What can I do to better support you through this?"" And while you're at it, say ""thank you"" and be specific: ""I really appreciate when you do [insert that great thing they do],"" or ""thank you for seeing I was losing it and stepping in with [insert that great save they made]."" The more you start spelling out what you're grateful for, the more you will find things to be grateful for. As for your partner: it never hurts to hear you're appreciated, and they might just return the favor. In the end, this time together could actually make you closer. (Take a look at the next question, too, for pointers about how to start a good conversation with your partner.)
5. Mix some excitement into the relationship, suggests Jancee Dunn, a frequent NYT Parenting contributor and the author of “How Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids."" According to one experiment just 90 minutes of novel experience a week for a month can make for a more satisfactory relationship for months to come. Consider planning a future trip together (just maybe don't buy the tickets yet). Or start a new at-home hobby together (you don't even have to be good at it for it to still be fun and different). Pasta making, anyone?
6. Create boundaries: they're a sign of love, too. How can you give each other space — when we all need a little more of that from the people we're now doing everything with? If you were both usually apart and at work before the pandemic, you probably didn’t talk for 14 waking hours straight. (At least your boss hopes you didn't talk for 14 hours straight.) So now if you're sudden-cubicle buddies, build in that time apart, so that seeing each other is a nice break at the end of the day.
If you're both working from home, create separate work spaces. (If you can, close the door.) And to keep those dividers up, even consider texting during the work day as opposed to screaming into the other room. That way you can each respond when you have a moment. It's also nice to have peaceful alone time, and you can find creative ways to make that a part of your everyday routine. Maybe you devy up who gets up first to fix the coffee or wake the kids, while the other luxuriates in bed a little longer. (Then switch the next day.)
7. Remember, this isn't actually the pandemic of 1918: We live in a technological world, so take advantage. Even if you're tired of video-chats, if you're separated from your partner, seeing each other's faces is an important way to stay connected. On Zoom you can even use the function to hide your own face making it seem more like an in-person conversation. (Plus, you shouldn't be staring at yourself anyway.) 
To bind your lives together, what's known as ""interdependence"", try video-chating while cooking from the same recipe (in two separate kitchens), then get dressed up for a candle-lit dinner via laptop, or take your FaceTime chat outside and go for a walk together or cozy up on the sofa and pick a TV show to watch at the same time: one-two-three-play. (Texting and sending audio message reactions throughout can be fun, too.) 
Evidence suggests that your long-distanced relationship can work just as well as those close together. So if you're in a newly long-distanced relationship, consider some hilarious (and actually helpful) advice from Holly Burns, a writer in the San Francisco Bay area and the survivor of a long-distance relationship in the era of AOL Instant Messenger. (The highlights include a few mind-twisters: ""talk about when you’re going to talk,"" ""be there even when you can’t be there,"" and ""get awkward early,"" among others.) And Ms. Marin, the sex therapist, has a few more suggestions about how to keep your sex life alive (including the use of remote sex toys, which your partner can control from afar).
8. But no matter what, prioritize quality time — it's more important than the quantity of it. Whether you're living together or rarely ever see each other these days, be intentional with the time you do have in-person, as well as virtually. Talk about the things you miss doing together and find ways to salvage old routines while creating new ones. Maybe that's rejuvenating your long-lost date nights, maybe that's starting them up for the first time. Consider among the options (side-by-side or via face-cam): cooking an elaborate meal or reading a book together — agreeing to a number of chapters a night or even reading aloud together. And in case you've forgotten how: Get dressed up for an evening in. Give your partner a massage. Pop open a nice bottle of champagne — OK, we'll leave the rest of the night up to you.

How to Help Your Relationship Survive a Lockdown",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
610,How do I date during this time?,"Yep, it's been a tough year for us single folks. (Me, too.) How many months has it been since you last had physical touch? I'm not even talking about sex; how about just a hug without fear that you might kill someone? Are we still counting the months? Have you broken the streak? And, no, your coupled friends absolutely do not understand. (And don't let them nod and smile and pretend they do.) Gagan Bhatnagar, 35, a clinical oncology consultant in London (yes, he's single), does understand, and you'll find other singles who do, as well, on his cry into the darkness on Twitter in December. 
As the writer Megan Nolan points out, just because you hadn't found your perfect match by March 2020, doesn't mean you should be hung out to dry until whenever you happen to get vaccinated — nor should you feel shame in lamenting your loss (however you define it): ""There are not a finite number of ways to have felt pain,"" in this pandemic, she writes. 
As if dating wasn't already hard enough, dating in a pandemic is that much harder — and, let's face it, even if you're not serious about the person, dating right now is a serious undertaking. Before we went by the adage that you are sleeping with every person your partner has ever slept with, but now, in a pandemic, you're hanging out with every person your partner has been near in the past 14 days. As such, if you are dating, you should be more transparent than you were before the pandemic about the social interactions you've had and the risks you've taken (including those outside your typical geographic space).
On the flip side, it's not healthy to be alone for too long, and one particularly disheartening study shows it can even increase the risk of premature death by 26 percent. 
But before we get too dating-doomsday, Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist who has spent some four decades studying romantic love across the globe, offers some positive thoughts about dating during this time, including among them: spending and chitchatting less, while slowing down to have more real conversations before things get physical. Gone are the days (we hope, at least for now!) from before the pandemic, when some 34 percent of American singles had engaged in sex before an “official” first date. And now deep into the winter months, we're experiencing an >a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/style/cuffing-season.html"">elongated cuffing season, which has been going strong since the summer.
Really getting to know one another, sharing our innermost feelings and life story, creates intimacy, love and, yes, even commitment. (By the way, men are equally likely to share their feelings as women.) And although romantic love may suddenly hit you over the face, those feelings of deep attachment take time — something many of us have a bit more of these days. In fact, the social psychologist Sara Konrath, Ph.D., says that ""somewhat ironically"" the pandemic is speeding up the slow dating movement.
You can start by getting to know each other over video-chat. To relax be sure to keep to your typical pre-date rituals: play that Beyoncé song, sip that glass of wine, give yourself that mirror pep talk. And then, since they're getting a peep inside your home anyway, set up in a spot that may lead to meaningful conversation. (Not the one corner of your apartment that isn't covered in unfolded laundry — because obviously that's not really you.) Try for a space that will encourage questions and deeper (maybe even funny) stories that help you get to know each other: situate yourself by your favorite piece of artwork (and talk about how you bartered for it on a sidewalk in Santiago and somehow, against all odds, it survived international travel in your over-stuffed suitcase), or by that piece of furniture that (just barely) survived a house party with a bit too much mezcal, or (here's a novel idea): how about by your open fridge. ('Why, yes, I do have four types of hot sauce.') Or what about by that pile of books by the couch (a bookshelf works, too) — pick up a few and share what you're reading. Then ask them to share from their favorite corner — although if one of you opens your fridge, expect reciprocal action.
And, unless you really do want to stare at yourself all night, be sure to hide your own face on Zoom, to make it seem more like the in-person dates of bygone days. For more ideas, here are six things you could consider for the first virtual date — from getting ready beforehand, to breaking the ice shortly after logging on, to deciding if you really want to see them again. (Speaking of which, if things go well, be sure to switch it up for future dates. You wouldn't go back to the same restaurant every time now, would you?)
But be aware: virtual dating does have its drawbacks; the chemistry you feel online may not result in sparks face-to-face. That's because you've gotten to know the person that they presented themselves as, not necessarily the person they prove to be, in, well, person. Yep, we're talking about that inexplicable vibe, built on that (yes, it's shallow) full-body view, hand gestures and our preferred distances from one another. On video chat, space is just an illusion; only in person do we have the chance to mediate boundaries and comfort zones. When we don't have that, we fill in the gaps with our imagination, painting a frog as a prince(ss), something a few of us are guilty of even in regular times.
So since taking it slow is both safer and statistically proved to cultivate a deeper relationship, if you decide to take the dive into the pandemic dating pool and see your date in RL, you might start with a socially distanced walk with masks. But no matter what, get to know them (ideally in an outside setting) before taking off each other's masks (or anything else you both so choose). The C.D.C. has a few guidelines for dating in person, too: Stay home if you feel sick, wear a mask in public, keep at least six feet from others and wash your hands after the date. Also, outdoor meetings are safer than indoors ones. 
And perhaps more important even than the date itself is the communication before and during your outing. You should be up front about your expectations and what precautions you plan to take — like if you're going to wear a mask or not. (Please, wear a mask, though.) You can try questions like: ""What does social distancing mean to you?"" or ""I'd like to meet up, but only if we wear masks and get tested first."" You can also phrase any considerations you have (like the idea of holding hands or kissing during a date) as a hypothetical to take the forwardness out of the proposal (if forward isn't your style). And if you're uncomfortable asking, just say so: naming the feeling automatically diminishes it. You can (and should) also share upfront the risks you've taken and ask about the other's comfort level in social interactions and any intimacy that requires less than six feet of distance. (Of note: some dating apps do some of the work for you. Bumble, for instance, uses a badge system to note user's social distancing comfort levels on dates, while Lex, an app for the queer community, includes Covid-19 and antibody test results on profiles.)
While on the date, be sure to verbalize any discomforts you have. Non-verbal cues (like turning away from your unmasked date) can signal disapproval, but in a time when issues of consent blatantly extend beyond the bedroom (what about hugging? removing your mask?), it's always best (and clearest) to use your words, especially when our masks cover much of our faces, literally masking our expressions. Remember: just because you like your date, doesn't mean he/ she/ they fall under what Marie Helweg-Larsen, a professor of psychology at Dickinson College, calls that supposed ""umbrella of invulnerability"" that we tend to assume of those we, well, like.
Now, we do need human touch — it's a proven mood stabilizer, and if you're still counting that time a cashier accidentally grazed your hand while giving you change, you may be feeling anxious, even depressed right about now. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner for disease control at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, put it simply: ""Abstinence for the duration of the pandemic is not going to work.""
In fact, the New York City health department has infamously provided a ""Safer Sex and Covid-19"" fact sheet with more-detailed and, shall we say, descriptive advice. These guidelines remind us: “you are your safest sex partner,"" the “next safest partner"" is someone in your household, and, of course, ""heavy breathing and panting can spread the virus further."" A number of other public health agencies have offered tips for dating and sex during the pandemic,.
Of course, if you are going to be physically intimate, you’ll need to have frank and honest conversations about your limits and your living situations. (Actually, while we're on the topic, that's a good conversation to have whether you're living in a pandemic or not.)

611,"I’m worried that I, or my friend, might be suffering domestic abuse. What should I do?","If you are in immediate danger call 911. If you are not in immediate danger but living in a dangerous situation at home, call the 24-hour National Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) or text LOVEIS to 22522. Services are available in more than 200 languages. And if you belong to the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community and are experiencing abuse or hate-based violence, call the Anti-Violence Project at 212-714-1141, which provides round-the-clock hotline help in English and Spanish. 
If you are a child who is being hurt at home, call the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline: 1-800-4-A-CHILD (22-4453). 
But please be careful when reaching out for help, especially if your partner, parents or caretaker monitors your phone and/or computer. If you fear being overheard, we have linked to the texting and chat tools for each website above. (Many local hotlines also have texting options.) Or ask a trusted friend to call for you. (Typically, that trusted person should not be related to your abuser.) Here you can search for domestic violence shelters by your zipcode. And this listing includes agencies by country in over 115 languages. 
And remember, if your abuser comes upon you while you're reviewing any website, you can hit the “Escape” button on your keyboard twice to exit immediately. (Many sites also have quick exits displayed when you visit.) No matter what, afterward, please clear your browser history and the phone number in your call log. (That includes clearing this question from your browser history.) Here's how to clear your history from any browser, and here's more on your digital security.
In the interim, if it's not possible to leave, try to make your home life as safe as possible. Think through your options: where is the safest place within your home? If an argument starts, where should you go? (For instance, you probably want to keep away from the kitchen where there might be knives, or the bathroom, which can also be quite dangerous.) Is it possible and safe for you to sleep in the car? These are questions you should brainstorm, if possible with that trusted friend.
Of course, abuse extends well beyond physical and sexual violence and may include isolation from friends, family and employment, as well as constant surveillance; strict, detailed rules for behavior; and restricted access to basic necessities including food, clothing and sanitary facilities. It can be triggered by stress, which is now at an all-time high: many people are out of work or with less of it, concerned about money, struggling with alcohol, drug and other addictions and cooped up in small spaces with family even easier targets than usual amidst frequent lockdowns and quarantines. No matter what, our lives are more shuttered to the outside world than they were a year ago, further isolating families and shattering support networks like schools, workplaces and religious institutions, among others. Now spending more time than ever with their abusers, families often have a harder time reaching out for help — while facing an even more extreme version of the age-old problem: leaving the devil you know for an uncertain future (in this case, one filled with fears of contracting Covid-19).
“It’s terrible for women who are living with their abusers right now,” said one woman in Chicago who had left her abusive husband. “It’s hard to walk out during normal times.” And these are anything but that. 
Even now, you are not alone. This is a problem affecting people around the world. If you are looking for services and resources in the United States check out the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence's compilation of organizations helping people who have been abused, which also lists specific resources for targeted sub-groups. (And if you yourself are struggling with coping mechanisms that have become addictions, you may want to check out some of our other questions including: ""How can I deal with the loneliness?"" and ""I am drinking a lot of alcohol. Should I be worried?"" If you need someone to talk to about issues like these, scroll up to: ""How do I find a therapist?"")
Early into the pandemic, reports at domestic violence hotline centers spiked in some places across the country, with calls and text messages mounting. But in other places and as time went on the calls tapered off — not because abuse has fallen but becuase those experiencing domestic violence have found it more and more difficult to distance themselves from their abusers and orders of protection have slogged through court systems operating below capacity. And along the same trend, reports of child abuse cases are also falling, which is worrisome.
Shut off from their typical daily reprieves at school and trapped in the hands of their abusers all day, children have even less agency than usual. Teachers are often the main reporters of suspected child abuse, but with many classes still virtual across the country, such small windows into the children's lives may not be cutting it. After all, people who abuse their families now have more control and supervision than before, making it easier for them to hide the mistreatment and harder for children to seek help. Additionally, it is nearly impossible for teachers to ensure their students are getting enough to eat or to suss out other forms of neglect or mental abuse that requires time, space and the trust that develops face-to-face. Earlier in the pandemic, the drop in reports was palpable, with cases dropping by 51 percent in New York City.
The pandemic has put in stark relief a rather consistent global failing to take care of those experiencing domestic violence, with countries' policies often falling like dominoes in the early onset of the pandemic. While such early missteps might be expected from some of the first countries ravaged by the virus, the fact that places like Britain, which ignored early warnings, were so under-prepared, lays bare a wider failing to take seriously and prioritize violence within the home. Meanwhile, the United States's mismatched patchwork of health policies made it difficult for service providers to adhere to changing guidelines while continuing to serve their clients. 
And none of this is surprising. The pandemic is just the latest in a series of crises that have shaken households, exacerbating the intensity and frequency of abuse cases, it also happened immediately after 9/11, with the economic downturn of 2008, and after both Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy.
For people concerned about a friend or family member who you believe to be mistreated, remember: you may not have success reaching out the first time. Oftentimes, the methods used to control partners and children “bear an uncanny resemblance” to those used by kidnappers against their hostages and repressive regimes against political prisoners, according to Judith Lewis Herman, a renowned trauma expert at Harvard University Medical School. Let the person know you're there and ready to talk whenever and wherever, keep reaching out and file reports if you witness or are told about the mistreatment. Those reports are anonymous and confidential.

612,I have the coronavirus. What should I expect my recovery to look like?,"For starters, we're really sorry you're sick and hope you feel better soon. There's no one-recovery-for-all handbook, unfortunately. But if you are at home and looking for a few tips, take a look at this how to. 
Some people show none or few symptoms, and find out they have been infected only when they test positive for antibodies. And there’s a range of experiences in between. We all recover at different rates, and some of us are still struggling to do so many months later. If you're still feeling ill — even long after you have technically recovered — you're not alone and you should be taken seriously. (You can quote us on that, if you'd like.) 
And you can quote that guy Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, too: “This is a phenomenon that is really quite real and quite extensive,” he said in December at a conference dedicated to issues regarding long-term Covid-19. 
These longterm symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, breathing trouble, depression and brain fog, which can make it difficult to string a coherent sentence together — along with other cognitive and psychological problems. Some have also experienced exercise intolerance and are unable to catch their breath during aerobic activity. (By the way, if you're recovering from Covid-19, you should really take your time returning to exercise.) 
We don't yet know how many people have prolonged symptoms in the postviral stage, but some estimates expect that one in three Covid-19 patients will experience lingering symptoms. Dr. John Brooks, the chief medical officer of the C.D.C.’s Covid response, estimated that it could be “on the order of tens of thousands in the United States and possibly hundreds of thousands.” And Dr. Ann Parker, who co-directs a post-Covid clinic at Johns Hopkins, notes that about three months after their acute illness, ""more than half of our patients have at least a mild cognitive impairment.” She also noted ""substantial mental health impairments.” 
The good news? (And yes, we do have a bit here.) At Mount Sinai Hospital, which opened the country's first Center for Post-Covid Care in May, most patients have recovered — with time.
Which brings us to this: No matter where you are on your road to recovery, remember that as in life, there is no real timeline (and it's definitely not linear), so don't push yourself to meet hypothetical goals, and be patient with yourself and others who are recovering and/ or helping you to do so. Go at the pace that feels comfortable for you and don't push yourself beyond your limits. (Only you can set these.) You may have arduous physical rehabilitation ahead.
And again, you're not alone. You can join virtual support groups like Body Politic to share advice. Several of our staff have also shared their experiences with longterm recovery from Covid-19. In a personal narrative, Mara Gay, a member of The Times’s editorial board, wrote that weeks after technically recovering, she was still using inhalers and ""can't walk more than a few blocks without stopping."" And our reporter Laura M. Holson has also had a long and strenuous recovery, writing that her experience with prolonged symptoms has been like facing death — twice. 
But they are surviving the pandemic, and so are you. Just don't forget, as you continue surviving, you're going to need what Ms. Gay calls her ""small army of people who are helping me heal.""

What to Expect After Having Covid-19",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
613,I am drinking a lot of alcohol. Should I be worried?,"Thanks for checking in. Clicking on this question is an important first step. Now, more than ever, all of our tics and bad habits are coming out to play. And drinking is a particularly hard one — with the stressors of the pandemic, a relaxing glass of wine or two at the end of the day can so easily slip into a bottle or two.
F. Scott Fitzgerald, a man who struggled with his drink and also lived through the Flu Pandemic of 1918, wrote of drinking: ""First you take a drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes you."" 
It doesn't have to be January to start a dry month — if you're looking to make a change.
Of course, not all drinking is a problem. If you imbibe, it makes a lot of sense that you are drinking more now. The coronavirus can be both stressful and boring, and drinking can dull the stress of waiting without an end date. Although you might normally have enjoyed wine with friends, drinking alone — especially if you live alone — is not inherently frightening. 
But we're dealing with a lot more now — working, schooling and parenting from home for many, and the drowning sense of loss of work and wages and the fear of losing even more stability for many others. It's enough to drive anyone to distraction — and to look for distraction, too. 
Substance abuse experts have worried the pandemic may also trigger more serious drinking problems and even create new ones for people who have never struggled with dependency before — and data so far supports just that. Addiction — including addiction to alcohol — is at its core a disease of isolation. Feelings of loneliness can increase the risk of drug and alcohol abuse in people with substance-use disorders, according to a recent study published in Drug and Alcohol Review.
The United States was struggling with a communal drinking problem before the pandemic — the National Survey on Drug Use and Health in 2019 recorded more than 14 million American adults having alcohol-use disorder (A.U.D.), the preferable medical term for alcoholism. Now, sadly, binge drinking has ticked up during the pandemic, according to several studies. And a study by the RAND Corporation in September shows Americans drinking far more — across the board, 14 percent more often in response to pandemic-related stress, with the increase particularly noticeable in women, whose heavy drinking days shot up by 41 percent in 2020.
If you're looking to cut back, you're not alone. One poll found that 15 percent of Americans planned to participate in Dry January. But with January behind us, you can pick any month to go dry — unless you have moderate to severe A.U.D., in which case first seek medical attention, as untreated severe alcohol withdrawal can be fatal. Get rid of any alcohol from your home, as well as your ever-more-frequented virtual space (both booze-related and booze-inducing content on all your devices). Research shows that this extended time away from the bottle is the best way to get a sense of your drinking behavior — plus, it gets you on the fast-track to cutting back.
And it's not just about the libations you're cutting out of your life. It's also about the joy you're putting back into it. After all, drinking has a few benefits: diminishing tensions and inhibitions, while adding a relaxing ritual to your day. (These days with most everything at home, it's hard to find when the workday ends and the rest of life, well, just continues on.) You don't want to replace one bad habit with another, but you can replace the bottle with other activities that bring joy and relaxation to your life — they may even be healthy. Instead of reaching for the bottle, call a friend to chat or if you can't get someone on the phone, write them a letter instead. Add daily exercise to your routine. Figure out how much you're spending on alcohol and start budgeting and planning a trip for after it's safe to travel again. Make a list of books you want to read and start ticking your way through them. Pick a new television series to watch virtually with friends and talk about it after. Or find something you're passionate about and start doing it (or doing more of it). Having a few go-to's is a nice way to keep from overusing one crutch while staying motivated to push on.
Also, try to quantify your drinking. If you can't keep track, you should consider what that means and maybe try keeping a drinking journal or a simple tally. Or, if you prefer an app to help you keep track, try Drink Control or Drinks Meter, which helps you track your drinks while also contextualizing your number compared with an anonymous database of over 6,000 other people's drinking habits across the world.
“Something very interesting happens when we put things on paper,” said Laura McKowen, who once started a journal of her own to confront her drinking problem. ""Because we have a lot of cognitive dissonance around drinking.”
There is no right answer as to when it’s time for you to be worried. Some questions, though, might help you get a clearer sense of the problem. Among others, you can check out the free alcohol screener from CheckUp & Choices.
And here are a few questions to consider, which are drawn from ones developed by rehabilitation facilities and medical centers: How many days a week do you drink? When you drink, how many drinks do you have? Is there a time of day that you most want to drink? Can you sleep without a drink?
What about your attitude toward drinking: Do you get angry or irritable when someone tries to take your drink away, or suggests that you may have a problem? Are you secretive about drinking? 
And, primarily, have your drinking patterns changed drastically since the pandemic started? Have you had major life changes — beyond lockdown — like losing your job or the death of a relative? (You may be looking for solace from these stressors at the bottom of your glass.)
If your answer to some, or many of these questions, is yes, it may be time to step back and reconsider. And if you try a sobriety month and find that going without alcohol is painfully difficult, you could have A.U.D., which is a disease necessitating treatment and is not your fault. Check out this N.I.A.A.A. navigator to determine the right treatment for you, and then use this services locator to find the help you need.
Social settings are an important part of recovery, and many treatment centers have closed down or greatly limited their in-person meetings, with a concentrated number of closures in the Northeast, because of New York being at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States this past spring. Although in-person meetings aren't an available option for many during the health crisis, a plethora of virtual support groups gather for meetings from the comfort of their beds or couches.
If you are looking to join a free virtual support group, there are many communities to choose from, among them: Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, SheRecovers, In the Rooms, Eight Step Recovery, Refuge Recovery, Recovery Dharma and LifeRing.
Ms. McKowen, author of “We Are the Luckiest: The Surprising Magic of a Sober Life,"" also founded the Luckiest Club, a virtual community group with membership and classes available for people struggling with drinking. Or try the online recovery program Tempest, which has different membership options depending on the intensity of the program you choose.
Some groups are also designed for people of color or belonging to certain age groups, interests and professions — like the sobriety support group Ben’s Friends, built for those in the restaurant industry, which has a notably difficult relationship with alcohol consumption. Another one: the Sober Mom Squad. Want to date without worrying about alcohol? Try Loosid, a sober social and dating network.

Reimagining Your Relationship With the Bottle",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
614,What are my chances of getting sick?,"If you’ve recently been exposed to someone with a confirmed case of Covid-19, you should take the following precautions.
A known exposure means you’ve been in close contact (within six feet) of an infected person for 15 minutes or more. You should qaurantine if you’ve cared for a person with Covid-19, shared food or utensils with them, or you think they may have coughed or sneezed on you. (The only exception to this is if you’ve already had the virus during the past 90 days. Then you are probably protected and don’t need to quarantine.) 
You have three options for quarantine, which means staying home and away from others until you know you haven’t contracted the virus. 
14-day quarantine: This is the safest and most reliable way to ensure that you don’t spread the virus to others after a potential exposure to it. Stay home for 14 days and monitor your health. You can still be around members of your household, but you should try to minimize contact with them, wear a mask and avoid sharing food and utensils if possible. Isolation at home is typically recommended only if you are infected with the virus. But if you live with a vulnerable person at high risk for complications from Covid-19, you may want to take additional precautions at home as well.
10-day quarantine: Federal health officials have said 10 days is a reasonable amount of time to spend in quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person, if you do not experience symptoms. Choose this option if your exposure was brief and 14-days of quarantine imposes a hardship. You should still monitor your health for four days after quarantine and avoid contact with vulnerable people. As always, wear a mask following your 10-day quarantine.
7-day quarantine with testing: Combining quarantine with virus testing allows you to reduce the quarantine time and minimize your risk of venturing out into the world too soon after a potential exposure. The C.D.C. recommends that if you choose this option, you should get tested on day five or later after the potential exposure. Once you have a negative test, you can leave quarantine after 7 days. You can take a rapid test or a P.C.R. test on Day 5 or later. If you want to be extra careful, take a few more rapid tests after Day 7 to give yourself peace of mind that you aren’t spreading the virus to others.
In fact, you can combine any of the above options with testing for extra security. (Scroll to our questions: ""How do I get tested? How long do tests take to come back?"" and ""I’m asymptomatic but was exposed to someone with the virus. Should I get tested?"" for more on getting tested.)

All 50 States Are Now Reopening. But at What Cost?",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
615,I’m worried about getting evicted.,"President Biden says his $1.9 trillion relief plan is paramount “to keep people in their homes rather than being thrown out in the street.” 
The third stimulus package puts almost $22 billion toward emergency rental assistance. And that money can be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses. Lower income families who have been without work for at least three months are prioritized. (See the question above for more specifics and to see if you qualify.)
Moreover, President Biden extended the federal eviction moratorium through March 31. Congress also put $25 billion toward rental assistance. 
But even still, tens of millions of people owing backrent may be uprooted anyway — the country’s data on evictions is so incomplete that city and state governments now with money to give away don’t know who is at risk of eviction and homelessness or how to get the money to those people. 
Most renters in this country live in private rentals, their income just above public housing thresholds or their immigration status barring them from other options, and the U.S. holds almost no data on this vast majority. In fact, according to one study, one third of U.S. counties have no idea how many people are evicted from their area each year. 
And so, against the backdrop of a federal moratorium and other state moratoriums, thousands of evictions (illegal and suspect) are currently forcing people from their homes, but without a federal database, such removals cannot be tracked or halted. 
President Biden has said that “housing is a right in America.” But referring to the two-month extension on the moratorium, Eva Rosen, author of “The Voucher Promise: ‘Section 8’ and the Fate of an American Neighborhood” writes: “While this temporary measure is a necessary Band-Aid on a gaping economic wound, housing is not yet a right in this country — far from it.”
If your landlord is pressuring you to leave, be sure you know your rights (they vary widely by state). Also, be sure to take a look at the National Low Income Housing’s federal eviction moratorium lookup tool to determine if your address falls under any of the federal eviction bans. And for more information on those bans, check out these detailed explanations from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which also provides this guidance for renters who need help.
Check out low or no-cost legal assistance through Legal Services Corporation’s map, as well as Just Shelter, a tenant advocacy group’s website on local organizations helping tenants in need, and Eviction Lab’s list of local and regional actions to halt evictions. (The research team out of Princeton University has developed the first national database of evictions and is also tracking evictions in real time across five states and 19 other cities, enabling them to determine if such moratoriums are working effectively.)
Depending on where you live, you may have several avenues to pursue before you’re kicked out.  
Cities like Philadelphia and Los Angeles are shifting to cash assistance programs. Moreover, the California Legislature recently passed a bill extending the state’s eviction moratorium and allowing renters to apply for assistance without formal leases (you can use documents like bills and school registrations instead). California will also put as much as $2.6 billion in federal rental aid toward clearing arrears. 
Meanwhile, New Yorkers unable to pay rent are now also temporarily protected under a new state law, which will halt almost all evictions for at least 60 days, even those where the leases have expired. Additionally, tenants who sign documentation saying they have been adversely affected by the pandemic can lengthen those protections until May 1.
Of course, renters aren’t the only ones suffering. Mom and Pop landlords are struggling, too — and with far fewer reprieves and little relief under New York’s recently passed law. (The law does however keep lenders from foreclosing on property owners with no more than 10 units until May 1 — again, if they are adversely affected by Covid. Even still, however, they must pay mortgage, taxes, water and heating bills.)
Although renters and small landlords may find themselves at odds against each other, they are actually in a similar predicament right now. If you find yourselves on either side of this problem, try to talk to one another — respectfully.
Tenants, let your landlord know where you’re at. If your landlord has a heart (and some actually do), they will appreciate knowing why it is you can’t pay (even if they keep pressing): let them know if you’ve lost your job or wages or have had a health or family emergency that has depleted your funds. Tell them you understand they may be struggling, too, and that you want to work out a payment plan that works for both of you.
Small landlords, approach your tenants and ask for their backstory. Why can’t they pay? Are there some fixes they may not be aware of? (Remind them about unemployment benefits and other assistance, which can help bridge the gaps.) If you’re in the position to do so, you can offer them the option of paying a reduced rent and waive part or all of the arrears or put them on a payment plan that reduces what they pay now but still requires them to pay you in full later. Or you can offer to pay them to move out by your chosen date, although depending on how you file the paperwork, they may have difficulty finding another place.
You can, of course, bring a case against your tenant, which will damage their credit (and future building owners can sue them anyway, even if you turn the other cheek), but David Skaller, a litigator and partner at the Manhattan law firm Belkin Burden Goldman, says that by holding off, you can actually strengthen your argument. Suggest the credit-ruining, burdensome court process as your final resort and try to broker a payment plan instead. (While New York’s legislation delays evictions, it does not cancel back rent, so for renters it’s nice to get ahead of it as much as they can, and for landlords some money in the pocket is still better than none.) 
The pandemic has not caused housing instability — but it’s made it far worse. Even before the pandemic, about 11 million households — or a quarter of all renters in the U.S.  — were spending more than half of their total income on housing. Meanwhile, overcrowding ticked up. Now, renters across the country already owed $53 billion in arrears, utilities and late fees as of January, according to data collected by Moody’s Analytics, which considers all delinquent renters. 
For families falling behind and noting increasing concern about hitting next month’s rent, that often means curbing groceries and other necessities just to pay the bills. 
Oftentimes, to offset housing costs, families are moving in together, squeezing into too-small spaces, while taking on the added risk of infection by enlarging their household capacity. (Additionally, studies show such living arrangements create additional problems within the household, including diminished long-term health and education achievement — further exacerbating the socio-economic and racial disparities that this pandemic has brought burbling to the surface.)
The good news is that there may be more help on the way. President Biden campaigned on a platform of universal housing vouchers which could provide stable housing to many more Americans — although as the current voucher system works, where landlords often decline to accept the vouchers anyway, many who receive help can’t use it and those who do use it often end up in neighborhoods segregated by race. The system would have to be overhauled first.
Conor Dougherty is a Times reporter who covers housing and business. “Housing should be an investment in people,” he said in an edited interview. “It shouldn’t be an investment in structure. When we think of housing as a necessity, we think about shelter in the way we think about food, but when we think of it as an investment, we lose sight of its role in health care and in family security. We would do well to start asking ourselves more frequently, ‘What is the point of having a home?’ To live in it.”

616,I don’t have health insurance. What can I do?,"We’ll start with the good news. Buying insurance through the federal program called COBRA will be a lot cheaper — for a little while. Often, recently unemployed people are faced with the option of keeping the insurance they had while employed — only if they can shell out large wads of money to keep it. Under COBRA, someone may have to pay even more than the full cost of the premium: at least 102 percent of it. But now, if you’ve lost your job or had your hours cut, the government will cover the entire cost of your premium from April 1 through Sept. 30. 
And since private health insurance companies will receive government funds to cover recently laid-off workers, as well as those who buy their own coverage, several million more people are anticipated to gain private insurance coverage.
However, the bill won’t help everybody. If you qualified for new, employer-based health insurance elsewhere before Sept. 30, you will no longer be eligible for that no-cost coverage. And if you left your job voluntarily, as many working mothers have, you won’t be eligible, either.
If you find yourself once again on newly shaky ground, you’re not alone. More American workers lost their health insurance because of job loss in a three-month stretch at the pandemic’s start than ever before over an entire year — about 5.4 million people from February to May 2020, according to one study by the nonpartisan consumer advocacy group Families USA. And that estimate grows when you take family members into consideration: In early May 2020, the Kaiser Family Foundation expected that even more people may lose their health insurance as companies lay off workers and cut benefits.
If you’ve lost your job (and with it your health insurance), or if you have not yet signed up for a policy, you may still apply through the marketplace through May 15, 2021. Spend some real time on the website, however, as not all policies are equal or even particularly helpful. That said, if you were to be hospitalized for Covid-19 in the United States, the resulting bills would be nearly insurmountable without insurance. (And check out these options if you lost your work-based insurance.)
Also, if you've lost wages and already have a marketplace plan, be sure to log back into the system (even if it's passed open enrollment) and adjust your income for the chance to receive greater subsidies. The third stimulus package also puts $34 billion toward expanding subsidies for the Affordable Care Act for two years. These changes would make upper-middle-income Americans newly eligible to receive aid in purchasing through the marketplaces, while also upping the subsidies provided to lower-income enrollees.
Navigating the complex web of alternatives and figuring out how to qualify can be a challenge. Here's more on the various coverage options.)
And if you have a job and a workplace plan, you may be able to change your plan, or add additional family members even outside an open enrollment period. (The Internal Revenue Service has changed its policy, so ask your employer if it’s providing this option.) 
No matter what, right now, it’s more important than ever to have health insurance — not only for your own personal safety, but for the safety of others as well. (After all, if you don’t have health insurance, the thought of that big bill could keep you from going to the doctor even when you really need medical attention.)

What About Health Insurance?",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
617,What about my 401(k)?,"Normally, we'd say, ""No, don't dip into your 401(k),"" — because that money will grow and can serve you well in the long run. 
But these are unprecedented times, and if there was ever a rainy season when you may find yourself without sufficient rainy day savings, this is probably it. Now, if you are experiencing pandemic-related financial problems, the CARES Act temporarily allows you to withdraw up to $100,000 from any tax-deferred account — that's your 401(k), 403(b), 457(b) and traditional individual retirement accounts — without any penalties. 
Yep, even if you're too young (the typical age requirement is 59½), you won't face that 10 percent penalty. And while income taxes are typically due on withdrawals the same year you take the money, you can now pay it back or put the money back over three years. (The CARES Act also makes it easier to get loans from your 401(k) plan, although most employers won’t loan you the money if you aren't still working for them anyway.) 
If you need some cash quickly, you're certainly not alone. More than 2.1 million Americans have so far taken money from their retirement plans at the five largest 401(k) plan administrators — Fidelity, Empower Retirement, Vanguard, Alight Solutions and Principal. Of course, that number only makes up about 5 percent of those companies's eligible 401(k) and 403(b) clients — certainly higher than typical years, but still not as high as you might expect: many of those most in need of the money (like the lower-paid workers disproportionately hit by pandemic-related job loss) don't even have such an account to raid. Only about half of American households have money in 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.
Of course, just because fewer penalties accompany such withdrawals, doesn't mean you should do it without careful consideration. To refurbish the difference down the road, you may have to save aggressively in the future, and if the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that we really don't know what's ahead or what will be possible to make up in the future. 
Let's consider a typical withdrawer (based on a Vanguard analysis): Anna, a 43-year-old earning $62,000 takes out $10,400. That $10,000 would have likely more than doubled to about $25,000 over the next 24 years. So to make up the difference, Anna would need to up her savings rates one percentage point a year. Your ability to later replenish your retirement savings will of course depend on how much longer you're able to work and how much you'll be earning in that time — as well as how much you had to take in the first place.

618,Will the new stimulus package help with my rent?,"Yes, for some folks. The third stimulus package puts almost $22 billion toward emergency rental assistance, in an effort to keep people on the cusp of eviction safely at home.
The second stimulus package passed in December also put  another $25 billion toward helping people catch up on rent — with a priority placed on families with lower incomes who have been unemployed for at least three months. 
Like last time, that money — which may be used for rent and utilities, as well as other housing expenses — will be distributed through state, local and tribal governments, and eligibility is determined on several conditions: 1. Your household income cannot exceed more than 80 percent of the area median income; 2. At least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability; and 3. Individuals must qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship in some capacity as a result of the pandemic. Priority assistance will go to lower-income families who have been without work for at least three months.
More than 500 emergency programs have been created during the pandemic, according to Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. (Here’s the group’s database and a map of some programs.) 
If you're having trouble with your landlord, you may have legal recourse, as well. Check out the Legal Services Corporation's search bar to find legal assistance for little or no cost near you, or this clickable map courtesy of Just Shelter, a tenant advocacy group formed by Matthew Desmond and Tessa Lowinske Desmond, for listings of other local organizations that can help.

619,What's in the Third Stimulus Package?,"President Biden’s first major piece of legislation as president — a third pandemic aid package, this one in the amount of $1.9 trillion — helps to finance vaccine distribution and expand the safety net for America’s most vulnerable — what the White House correspondent Jim Tankersley described on “The Daily” as an insurance policy of sorts, promising government help if needed. (If it’s not needed, less money will be spent.) 
The package will provide meaningful stimulus checks to families (up to $1,400), extend unemployment benefits and will establish long-term structural changes to the economy. This year it is expected to cut poverty by a third, while cutting in half child poverty through expanded tax credits, food aid, and rental and mortgage assistance. 
At a news conference, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California called the package “the most consequential legislation that many of us will ever be a party to.”
Here’s a look at the numbers:
*$350 billion for state, local and tribal governments
*$130 billion for primary and secondary schools
*$45 billion for rental, utility and mortgage assistance
*almost $40 billion for higher education
*$30 billion for transit agencies
*$14 billion for vaccine distribution
*$10 billion for state infrastructure projects
*Billions more for small businesses and live performance venues

620,What about sick leave?,"The Families First Coronavirus Response Act required some businesses to give employees paid sick leave. It also expanded family and medical leave. But all that expired at the end of 2020. 
If you didn't use your sick leave, your employer may still provide it — but that's completely up to them. (What you were previously entitled to can be found right here.) That said, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 provides businesses with an incentive to continue providing such paid leave, by extending employer tax credits (a full reimbursement) for the voluntary benefit until March 31, 2021. So if you ask your employer for the leave, be sure to let them know that it could help you both. Employers should consult the I.R.S. with questions about these tax refunds. And here's a good place to start.
And if you are self-employed, there's good news! You can also still claim your tax credit for a given number of sick days or time taken off (only for certain reasons) to care for children or family members. And you can take that time through March 2021. Additionally, you may compute your credit using either your 2019 or 2020 income — whichever helps you most.

621,How do I get a new job right now?,"This is going to be a slog. 
And if you've been laid off, you may feel particularly disinclined to muck around in it. You'll likely need to start looking, but you also need to take care of your mental health surrounding the job loss. (For many of us, work is about more than money, although money is obviously a pretty big part of it.) 
1. Go ahead and grieve that lost job — even a job you didn't particularly enjoy at the time. You may now be stressed financially, stressed because you feel as though your identity has been taken from you, stressed because you can't see what comes next — maybe all of the above. If you have the luxury of taking some time before jumping right back in, then do that. But for most people looking to get a job as quickly as possible, it's going to be about giving yourself that daily grace in all parts of your life, and maybe especially in your job search. 
2. Feel the feelings: Don't dwell on them but also don't wall them off. “Think of your emotions as data, as information,” suggested Laura Huang, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. “Rather than blindly being led by them, interrogate them. Ask yourself why you feel shame or self-doubt. Learn from it. Use your emotions to your benefit.”
3. You are the author of your own story: It's all about framing. Don't fall into negative thinking, furthering the mental harm. About 40 percent of American workers have lost their job at least once  — and that figure was from before the pandemic. So if you're telling yourself you're a loser because you lost your job during one of the worst crises in American history, by that methodology, practically half the American work force were already epic losers who couldn't even keep a job in the ""normal"" times. You see where I'm going with this, I hope. (We're not all losers.)
You are likely just as competent as your colleagues that are still employed. It feels personal, but it probably isn't. This time, it's not them, it's not you, it's just this crazy pandemic that is strangling everything and everyone. 
4. So, control the narrative: When the chips are down, people tend to believe the worst in themselves — and in others. When talking about losing your job, be sure you use the right words. If you were ""laid off"" because your company wasn't doing well, that's very different than being ""fired"" for cause. Don't give yourself or others the wrong impression (even subconsciously) about what happened.
5. In the meantime, find something else that fulfills you and can carry you through the hard times. Reorganize the house, start reading through that pile of magazines in the corner, try your hand at writing that short story you've always imagined.
6. When you do start looking for a job, value your time as much as your employer should have done. Sure you have some extra time on your hands, but use it to your advantage — don't waste it, says Latesha Byrd, a career and executive coach. Scrolling through listings and spewing out generic applications isn't going to tell employers who you are and it's not going to get you a job. Plus, you're already worn a little thin, no need to waste whatever energy you're currently running on. You could better spend that time creating a personal website, bolstering your social media presence or reaching out to folks you already know in your field of interest.
7. Its all about harnessing clarity, confidence and control, says Ms. Byrd. Think critically about your skills, values and passions and determine how those fit into a job and workplace. Then, pep yourself up by focusing on what you bring to the table (as well as your past accomplishments). Oh, and lose the self-doubt. (As my mother would say: it doesn't become you.) To the extent you can, exert control over what's in your power: Don't turn your application in right before deadline, don't be late for that Zoom interview, etc. And show people how to see you (by presenting yourself that way): Write a witty cover letter, or if you're good on social media, pull that into your application. (But just to be super clear: we're not suggesting you pull an Elle Woods and put your résumé on scented paper.)
8. If you don't have to, don't jump at the first job just because it was offered to you. (We know, this is a priviledged perspective, and if you have to take the job, then by all means take it.) But this is particularly important if you're looking at a job you'd like to stay in for a while (especially if it's within the industry you're trying to make your career): be sure that you weigh the pros of a quick fix compared to the long term. If, for instance, you accept a lower salary, you'll have a hard time pulling yourself up later. 
And no matter what, be clear with the potential employer about what you want out of the job. Maybe with the kids at home, you're not looking for a vertical move and while your résumé shows you could do more you actually prefer to do less. (Don't say that exactly, warns opinion writer Roxane Gay), but let them know what you want and why you feel you're best for a supporting role. Or, if you want that vertical position, then by all means, raise that hand.
9. But, also manage your expectations. Finding a job is going to be greatly dependent on the industry you're looking to (re)join, as well as the risks you're willing to assume and how far down the ladder (within or between industries) you're willing to fall. Lots of industries are laying off people for the foreseeable future, while others are hiring in droves. 
As of January, the economy had 9.1 million fewer jobs than a year earlier. That 6.1 percent shortfall is consistent with a severe recession. (Even excluding the hard-hit leisure and hospitality sectors, which account for 3.6 million of the total lost jobs, employment is down 3.7 percent, even then consistent with a moderate recession.) These numbers signal a stalling economy (even a reversal in some industries), with segments of the economy that aren't directly hit by the pandemic still feeling those effects.
After five months of slowed hiring, in December 2020, employers sliced payrolls by 140,000 (the first dip since mass layoffs last spring), according to data from the Labor Department. And the losses were felt disproportionately among low-wage workers, often Black and Latina women. And by the end of the year, nearly four million Americans were experiencing long-term unemployment, being without a job for more than six months. Of course, the true problem is much larger than four million Americans, because that number vastly undercounts the people who are without work but not currently looking. (It's a dark world out there and can be overwhelming just to start, not to mention all the added stressors of teaching the kids from home.)
And even after that, close to a million unemployment claims were filed each week for several weeks in January. 
Plus, some industries which shed workers for safety reasons at the start of the pandemic, have turned to automated services instead, meaning the jobs aren't there when the workers return for them.
No matter who you are, or what you were doing before, you’re probably going to need to be flexible. 
Taking a lower-wage service job — grocery stores, pizza delivery — might also work, but you'll need to balance financial needs with health concerns, because essential workers are at a greater risk of contracting Covid-19.
Or if you have the skill set and are looking for a temporary job with purpose, you could follow in the footsteps of these British workers, who took temp jobs as coronavirus testers, contact-tracing callers and hospital housekeeping workers.
And a note for those who feel like their career was cut off before it even began (yes, we're looking at you, new graduates), keep in mind that people in their early 20s especially are entering a terrible job market. Manage your expectations and know that there will be time down the line to get things right.
Plus, there's lots of advice on the job search on TikTok. Check out a few, including: how to write a résumé that's not too little or too much but just right and what to do when a potential employer ghosts you.
And for all of us: the vaccine rollout is key to pulling the labor market up. The faster we all get vaccinated, the faster many of us can re-enter the work force safely. In the meantime, there's some good news: while the United States has invested much less in its work force than countries like Canada, Germany and Scandinavian countries, which spend three, six and 12 times as much (as a percentage of economic activity) on government employment, training and other labor services, the United States could finally turn that around. Imparting new skills in our workers is something that even has bipartisan support in Congress.

So You Lost Your Job, Don't Spiral: You're Still Amazing — Here's a Few Reminders",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
622,Can I travel within the United States?,"It's really better not to. In general, travel increases your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at home. “Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,"" the C.D.C. says.
But if you must leave, be sure you're up on the latest restrictions at home — and wherever you're going. Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine. The patchwork of policies can be confusing, so here’s a regularly updated list of changing statewide restrictions. (And be sure to keep an eye out in the days leading up to the trip and until you're back home, so you don't get caught in the crosshairs.) 
If you're working at the office (same for kids back in the classroom), you should also reach out to your employer to determine their travel guidelines, if you're not already familiar. (They could be more restrictive.) You may be able to use paid sick leave for post-travel quarantine. But also check your eligibility for two weeks of paid sick leave under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (although that is best used if you actually get sick). Thirteen states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring paid sick leave for eligible employees, but check to be sure quarantine qualifies for paid leave under the applicable law. If you're not able to take time off afterward, you might want to reconsider taking that trip.
If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk. (And see the question above for information on flight capacity to help determine which airline you choose.) 
And no matter where you go within the United States, the C.D.C. now requires you to wear a mask — punishable by “criminal penalties,” according to an 11-page order issued by the agency in February. The rule applies to all transportation hubs, which the C.D.C. defines to include any: “airport, bus terminal, marina, seaport or other port, subway station, terminal, train station, U.S. port of entry or any other location that provides transportation.” Transit operators are charged with enforcing the national mask-wearing mandate, which a spokesperson for the C.D.C. said in reality is a largely voluntary measure.
Getting tested before and after travel is always a good idea — and some states require it. Check out the Department of Health and Human Services's list of testing sites in each state. (And be sure to scroll up to our questions on quarantining and getting tested: ""What are my chances of getting sick?  "", ""If I am exposed to the virus, do I need to quarantine? What if I've done something high-risk for exposure like flying or participating in a protest?"" and ""  How do I get tested? How long do tests take to come back?"")
You may soon need a negative Covid-19 test to board any domestic flight, anyway, says Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. (Since January, the C.D.C. has required international travelers coming into the U.S. to come bearing negative results. The upped precautions are a result of concerns about more contagious variants of the virus coming in from countries including Britain and South Africa. And those concerns have merit: B.1.1.7, which was first found in Britain, is spreading rapidly through the United States, according to a recent study.)
If someone gets Covid-19 while traveling, you're going to be stressed, so the more you have planned in advance the better. Would you be able to extend reservations, change transportation, etc.? There is talk that airlines may extend flexible cancellation policies at least until the industry recovers to 2019 levels. (And the industry group Airlines for America doesn’t think that will happen before 2023 or 2024.) But, of course, even now, check with your airline and be sure to check that fine print.

623,I’m American. Where am I allowed to travel to?,"That depends on where you want to go — the American passport doesn't carry the privilege of times of old.
Many countries around the world, including the United States, have imposed travel restrictions to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Airport closures, the suspension of all incoming and outgoing flights, and nationwide lockdowns are just some of the measures countries have adopted in an effort to help contain the pandemic. (Even domestic travel has its snags. (See the question above for more tips for traveling through the U.S.) 
Many countries, including much of Europe, still remain off-limits to American visitors because of the high rate of coronavirus within the United States. Even so, more than six dozen others have started to welcome U.S. citizens. We consistently update this list of international destinations that allow U.S. citizens to enter, though there are some restrictions.
To determine the coronavirus risk in a particular country, visit the C.D.C. website for a four-tier ranking system providing some guidance, along with information on entry requirements and restrictions detailed by country. And go to the U.S. Department of Transportation website for recommendations for safer and smoother air travel.
Down the road, you may need a vaccine passport, or digital documentation proving that you have been vaccinated or have tested negative for Covid-19. Such documentation would be useful to getting things back to normal, with participation allowed at certain larger events or for entry into other countries, based on proof of inoculation. This wouldn't be the first time that such documentation was required for travel. (Think of the vaccine requirements for yellow fever, rubella and cholera.) Plus, if you've traveled internationally since the pandemic, you may have already had to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test — many countries are requiring proof ahead of entry, so this would make that process a whole lot easier. And lots of work is being done to make sure such universally accepted documents are accessible to the masses while still protecting your privacy.
But if you really want to get away, remember that by curbing your travel now you can get back out into the world (without a mask!) that much sooner, if you'll just keep your suitcases tucked away a bit longer. Consider instead making a quick escape with this virtual trip around the world, traveling to this year's ""52 Places to Love in 2021.""

624,Should I refinance my mortgage?,"There are real savings to be had by doing so. Refinancing your mortgage allows you to renegotiate for a better loan at a lower interest rate — saving money in both the short and long term. It will also allow you to liquidate the equity in your house, negotiating a line of credit to put cash in your pocket during these tough times. (But remember, that means you'll be paying for your house again, so it's a quick short-term solution that could make things more difficult down the line.) 
Mortgage rates have never been lower, with rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage at a 50-year low, dipping below 3 percent. (But with home owning suddenly more affordable, refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since the housing bubble burst of 2008, so be prepared to get in line.)
If you qualify, then refinancing a mortgage at the national median home price (about $285,000) would save you more than $100 a month in payments. (That's about $50,000 over the course of the loan.) Of course, in more expensive coastal areas, you could save a whole lot more. 
When considering your refinancing options, it's all about what you're looking to get out of the refinancing deal.
If you want to reduce your monthly payment: You can refinance into a different 30-year loan with a lower rate. However, you may end up paying more interest over time. (Consider making extra payments toward the loan principal to shorten the term, if you can.)
If you want to be mortgage-free sooner: Shorten the term to 15 or 20 years, which could lead to both savings on interest and more budget flexibility in retirement.
If you don't plan to move any time soon: Switching from an adjustable to a fixed-rate mortgage could help you save long term (because these rates probably won't get much lower).
You should only consider refinancing if you plan to be in the home long enough to get your closing costs back. Do the math:
Total costs ÷ Monthly savings = Total number of months to recover savings
(Note: If you're shortening the mortgage length, then don't use this formula and use a refinance break-even calculator instead.)
Now, before you apply, remember:
1. Check your credit reports (at all three credit rating companies) for any potential inaccuracies.
2. Be careful about your credit standing. (For instance, opening a new credit card could affect your score.)
3. With both requests and defaults on the rise, lenders are getting picky, tightening standards. So while average rates are at record lows, some borrowers are actually ending up paying more or don't qualify at all. (That means those who are self-employed or have a fluctuating income are likely to be at a disadvantage.) 
Consider using digital systems that check your assets and salary. Be sure to scan and upload your documents, so you have quick access to them and don't lose anything. You can also consider requesting a virtual appraisal. Then to preserve your lender relationship and fast-track the refinancing process, follow these six simple steps (and, yep, they apply to most relationships):
1. Eventually, you have to stop swiping: Yes, you may find an even better rate somewhere out there, but while you're searching, you could miss that great deal right in front of you.
2. Communication is key: Don't let voice mails or emails (even those that wind up in spam) go unanswered. If you value the lender relationship, then show them by providing what they ask for promptly. Otherwise, you could lose your spot to someone else who seems more interested (and actually calls them back). 
3. Be a sharer: Over-document your backstory. Explain income gaps (like parental leaves and vacations) with hospital bills, baby pictures, a note from your employer, etc. And do it before they ask.
4. Explain the red flags: Don't assume that the person appraising your house knows your neighborhood. Brainstorm with your lender or mortgage broker about the red flags that could affect your valuation, and make copies of comps that your appraiser could miss. Also, if you remodeled, be sure to show off before and after pictures that you slide into a single folder with those comps.
5. Don't mess up a good thing once you have it: Don't open up any new credit cards, auto loans etc. Lenders often double-check the credit report: you don't want to set off alarm bells. Extra questions could slow down the process.
6. Mistakes will be made — make sure you can prove it's not your fault: Things may drag on long past that lock period that keeps your interest rate the same no matter market changes for a set period of time (sometimes 90 days or longer). You're not going to be in that honeymoon stage forever: there's more time for you to make a mistake. If it's your fault, you could get stuck with extra charge fees or a raised interest rate. (And those mistakes can be costly!) At the start, get your lender to agree in writing to extending the rate lock if it's their fault. And then make sure it's never your fault. Keep a record of text messages, email time-stamps and phone logs. Make a spreadsheet and include screenshots, so if there's a question you can prove your innocence quickly.

Is Now the Time to Refinance Your Mortgage?",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
625,What’s going on with work visas?,"President Biden has already begun dismantling some of his predecessor's ""America First"" immigration policies through a slew of presidential orders intended to welcome back refugees, foreign workers and asylum applicants — but the effects will not be immediate, and the president has not yet lifted the immigration ban that a federal judge halted in October. 
As of the end of 2020, more than 380,000 immigrant visa applicants were awaiting their consular interview, the final step in the immigration process — and a backlog that would normally take as much as a year to go through. Of course, these are not normal times. Between former President Trump's immigration ban and staffing shortages at U.S. consulates across the globe, as well as pandemic-related logistical challenges, the backlog could weigh down the system for years.
In the first months of the pandemic, President Trump temporarily suspended new work visas and barred hundreds of thousands of foreigners from seeking employment in the United States, part of a broad effort to limit the entry of immigrants into the country. Very few people were still allowed in. 
Claiming that he was trying to preserve jobs for Americans, Mr. Trump blocked visas for a wide variety of jobs, including those for computer programmers and other skilled workers who enter the country under the H-1B visa, as well as those for seasonal workers in the hospitality industry.
That temporary suspension of work visas was opposed by many businesses — including tech companies in Silicon Valley and manufacturers — whose leaders said it would block their ability to recruit workers for jobs that Americans are not willing or able to perform. Most foreign doctors willing to help an ailing America, could not even get into the country.
But in October, Judge Jeffrey S. White of U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California temporarily blocked further implementation of the order, stating in part: “The proclamation completely disregards both economic reality and the pre-existing statutory framework. Furthermore, without any consideration of the impact on American firms and their business planning, the proclamation changes the scope of immigration policy in the United States.” 
Despite the judge's ruling, the entry ban has continued under President Biden. In February, his senior administration officials declined to provide a timeline for lifting the ban. Until then, consulates cannot resume visa processing, and the backlog only grows. The State Department’s own assessments of consular operations suggest they won't be able to handle the overflow. And staff shortages, hiring limits and a budget shortfall will only perpetuate the problem. Additionally, the new administration has still not determined how to adjudicate visas in places with high Covid-19 case counts. Plus, the immigration process still includes in-person interviews in which the applicant's body language and word choice is analyzed to assess potential risks to national security. 
U.S. consulates typically issue about 500,000 immigrant visas each year — most to ​spouses, children and parents of U.S. citizens and permanent residents. But even just concentrating on the tiny subset of people still now immigrating into the U.S., State Department data shows that the processing time is a third the rate as before the pandemic. Now losing out on massive visa processing fees, State Department officials expected a loss of $1.4 billion in 2020, with continued losses through at least 2022. And staffing shortages couldn't be immediately fixed, even with federal funding aimed at doing so.
If you are looking to get your own visa processed or to help a friend or family member with the process, you should reach out to an immigration lawyer and your employer to determine potential legal recourse. Some lawyers are working on such cases for free.

626,My trip was canceled. How do I get a refund?,"The refund game has changed a lot over the past year — and often in your favor. (Just be sure to check the fine print.)
If your flight is canceled, you're entitled to a refund, period. (Although if you booked with an agency, it may be more complicated.) Other travelers hoping to rebook have taken vouchers for trips at future dates, but if you want a refund, here's how to get it: 
1. Send a few emails to establish a paper trail. Be polite, understanding and as specific as possible, while remaining firm.
2. Sometimes the social team is more helpful than customer service, so try Twitter and Instagram, too. (You can send direct messages or kindly flood them with comments.)
3. If that doesn't work, file a complaint with the Department of Transportation, including documentation of your failed correspondence. Then let the company know you filed a complaint. (The department's policy may entitle you to a cash refund.) 
From January to October 2020, the 11 largest airlines in the U.S. gave out $11.75 billion in cash refunds — an 86 percent year-over-year increase — according to the industry group, Airlines for America. And airlines may even extend flexible cancellation policies at least until the industry recovers to 2019 levels. (Airlines for America doesn’t think that will happen before 2023 or 2024.) 
As for cruises, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lifted the no-sail order in October, but most cruise companies have yet to take up sail. So unless you planned way ahead (or were very optimistic), you're probably not still canceling cruises. However, if you need to cancel and did not purchase directly through the cruiseline, remember, that some charter companies have made commitments to other companies and may be stuck. 
For other services, like an Airbnb, you may be able to simply move the dates and keep the trip — for a safer date in the near future, of course.
Sarah Firshein, a travel writer for The Times, has been writing helpful columns on how to get your refund. Are you having a hard time getting a refund from a … Travel company? Hotel? Tour? Airline? Anything? If you’re stuck, shoot us a note: travel@nytimes.com.

627,How long can I expect my unemployment benefits to continue?,"For those already receiving unemployment benefits, third relief package extends these benefits for another 25 weeks, until Sept. 6. And  the extra $300 will continue coming in through that same date. Additionally, the first $10,200 of those benefits (for 2020 only) have been made tax-free — so long as you make an income of $150,000.
As for those receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which covers the self-employed, gig workers, part-timers and others who not typically eligible for unemployment benefits, you can also receive a total of 79 weeks, up from 50, with benefits running through Sept. 6.
Meanwhile, if you've exhausted regular state benefits and are now receiving money from the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, those benefits will last a total of 53 weeks, up from 24, also going through Sept. 6.
And that extra $300 will not mean the difference in calculating your eligibility for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, either.
Now, if you earn a mixed income of self-employment and wages from other employers and have been quashed into a lower state-issued benefits based on your lower wages, then you'll get an extra $100 weekly payment, called the mixed-earner supplement — again through Sept. 6.

628,How should I explain this to my kids? How is their mental health?,"If you've noticed regressive behaviors in your kid, that's normal. If the kid has been acting out more, that's normal. And, yep, if the kid has been super happy at home, that's normal, too. Just like the rest of us, kids react to stress in different ways — the important thing is to be there for them.
The protections we get from positive relationships, along with sleep, exercise and a healthy diet are important for keeping those stressors in check. Parents: that mean's a lot of this is on you. (What isn't these days?) So you may want to check out the American Academy of Pediatrics's clinical interim guidance, released this fall, which walks parents through their role in supporting children through their emotional needs right now.
Look out for these warning signs that your kid may be stressed out:
-Has your young child lost skills she had already mastered? This is called regression, and it's normal for children to proceed, regress and proceed again; nothing in life is truly linear, but if it becomes a troublesome pattern, it could again indicate internalized stress.
-Are your kid's eating habits changing? Is he eating more or less? Stress can affect the diet, and while it's totally normal for a kid to eat a lot one day and hardly anything another, watch these habits carefully to determine if such behavior appears normal or an indicator of something bigger.
-The same goes for unhealthy sleeping patterns (sleeping too much or not enough).
-What about trouble concentrating or a sudden uptick in headaches, stomachaches or muscle tension?
-Has the kid turned the home into a zone of negativity? Perhaps you're hearing a lot of negative self-talk and general pessimism about others and their environment: ""I'm so stupid, you're so stupid, the world's so stupid,"" etc. Help your child reframe those thoughts in a more positive light — that will be important for how your kid tackles the day (or maybe just that tough homework assignment), as well as for the rest of the family. (Negativity is contagious, too.)
-Has your teenager closed off (more than usual) about how they feel? Starting in middle school, some kids may begin hiding their concerns out of “fear, shame or a sense of responsibility to avoid burdening others,” according to the American Psychological Association.
-Or has your teenager become more hostile and irritable (again, more than usual), withdrawn (more) from you or even from close friends? These can also be signs of stress.
When talking to our kids, word choice is important, but it's not just about what you're telling your kids, it's also about how you're telling them. Children under the age of 5 need you to seem OK (even if you're not): what you say in answer to their questions is secondary to how you seem to think and feel about those words. That means prioritize the way you present the information (your demeanor, tone), because that may be more important even than the information itself. Naturally, it affects the way they process it. Try to avoid hyperbolic words and phrases with any child, but that's particularly important with our youngest children, who understand the world in magical terms (monsters under their beds and tooth fairies under their pillows) and even our kids through about age 10, who have started to understand logic, but not irony and sarcasm. At this age, they're worried not just about themselves but others, too, which can make this pandemic a lot scarier. Be sure to listen to their questions, explain things clearly and ask them what made them think or ask a certain question. It's important to understand the source and substance of the concern in order to effectively combat fear with knowledge. By age 11, your kid has probably begun to understand abstract thought, and as they progress through adolesence is also dealing with social and bodily changes that can be overwhelming separate from the pandemic. Be empathetic and remind them (if needed) why we're all having to give up so much right now. 
Madeline Levine, a clinical psychologist, reminds us: ""This is not the apocalypse. The crisis will pass. In the meantime we will have to teach our children how to deal with uncertainty. We don’t have to love it. But we do have to model it."" She has also offered tips about how to do that, tailored to your kid's age.
And if you're stressed it's probably coming out in how you're reacting to and explaining the changing situation to your kids (not just your words, but your facial cues and body language, too). Give yourself grace and let yourself cut corners if you need to. It's really OK: no one's popping in to judge you, anyway. To the extent possible put a timer on your worries. Allow yourself maybe 30 minutes to really dwell and then after that 30 minutes, write them down to consider down the line. If that doesn't work, try keeping your worries at a distance for an hour at a time. Remember, worrying over the unknown is not in fact going to do anything to change it. 
If you're part of a two-parent household, now is not the time to turn on your partner (even if you really do think they've totally lost it this time). Keep an open and non-judgemental dialogue about your own emotions. Starting sentences like: “I need” or “I would feel better if,” can help cue your partner to what will make you feel better. (Because, obviously, by that really stupid thing they just did, they haven't been getting it right so far.) And if you need a starting point for processing your own emotions, take a look at: “Am I depressed? Or just in a bad mood?”, ""Help! I’m frustrated with my partner"" and ""How do I find a therapist?"" among others.
“When parents are stressed and worried, kids become stressed and worried,” said Dr. Carol Weitzman, a developmental-behavioral pediatrician.
Even our youngest children — as young as just 3 months — can tell when their parents are sad or angry — and can also feel those emotions. In fact, infants and toddlers are so aware of their parents's emotions (noting small changes in how they're held, facial expressions, tone of voice and changes in routine), that if you don't keep your own stress in check it's literally going to rub off on the baby.
If your child is worried about the pandemic, listen and validate those concerns. Don't shrug it off with a comment like “Everything will be fine."" Such dismissive reactions can make children feel like they’re not being heard, said Abi Gewirtz, a clinical psychologist and professor at the University of Minnesota. Kids want to understand. (That's the why behind all those ""why's?"") Moreover, talking about the pandemic and its impact may help alleviate harmful stress. 
Plus, with understanding we all (kids included) start to see a way forward (and a light at the end of this long tunnel of unspecified length). To begin, focus on what's in our control, what we can do day to day to help others — like staying home whenever possible and wearing a mask when we go out. Just like the rest of us, kids like having a purpose and being a part of the solution.
There's another kind of talk — one you may have already experienced in the past year — which is even harder, but also crucially important. And that's talking about the grief we've all been experiencing in different ways. Maybe that's the death of a loved one, a divorce, the loss of Mom's job or the house, or even the smaller but still painful losses like missing senior year, prom, graduation ceremonies — or even one of those infrequent play dates. While those conversations will look quite different depending on the type of loss, and permanent changes (especially death) will require ongoing support and conversation, all of these losses (even the ones that may seem inconsequential in the long run) can hit hard these days. We've already lost so much in the past year — including our very sense of normal — and we've likely had fewer joys to look forward to and fill in the gaps. Now even the small things feel so much bigger. Just like the rest of us, your children need time, love, support, and, yes, even space to process these emotions. And even though it goes against every parental instinct you have to try to make things better, remember it's OK for things to not always be OK ... so long as we recognize those times and help each other through them. 
Along with the talking, you should also build in some important structure to the days and months that still lie ahead. For kids who like structure, try to keep things as close to their ""normal"" schedule as possible, and even for those who take the day in stride, a little extra support can be helpful — in other words: lean into routine. (For a starting point, take a look at our questions: “Help! I'm now both working and parenting from home. What should I do?” and “How can I keep my kid on track?”) 
And don't forget to make sure your kids are getting interactions with other people to help keep their spirits up — whether that be virtually or through distanced or pod play dates. (Scroll down to ""What about socializing with other children? Can we do it safely?"" for some ideas about the best ways to go about this.) 
All this is to say: No matter your child's age, check in on them. Even if they push you away, be that annoyingly persistent parent you promised you'd never become and keep knocking on that locked door. We all need someone to ask how we're doing now and again. Maybe you check in with everyone in the family around the table at dinner every Monday night. Maybe it's individual check-ins that aren't on a schedule. Whatever it looks like, just be sure they know you're their for them — always.

How to Keep Children’s Stress From Turning Into Trauma",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
629,"How does this affect kids, physically? Can they transmit coronavirus?","Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and their symptoms tend to be mild. 
But Covid-19 can still be serious for children. A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City health department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. (There is also a case of a 12-year-old Covid-19 long hauler.)
Moreover, federal data released last fall shows a racial disparity that has continued this year: children of color have been most harshly affected, making up an overbearing proportion of the children who have died or developed life-threating complications from the virus.
Monitoring your child is important both for their health and for the health of the community. Children can transmit the virus to others, although schoolage children are less likely to do so than older populations.
If your child develops severe symptoms, such as trouble breathing, an inability to eat or drink, or a change in behavior, you should contact a doctor.

What to Watch for When it Comes to Your Kid and Covid-19",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
630,What is college going to be like this spring?,"For most college students, it has been a rough last few semesters. But across the country, administrators were optimistic that the lessons learned at the start of the academic year would serve them well, enabling them to bring more students safely back to campus, through consistent testing, thorough contact tracing and, of course, requiring masks and social distancing. 
As a result, the University of Michigan — which had 2,500 confirmed cases this fall, shifted to more remote class offerings in the spring, upped its testing, limited dorm room capacity to one occupant and set a no-tolerance policy for rule violations. Even still, students coming back to campus brought with them the highly contagious B.1.1.7 variant. And from the start of the year through early February, the school has announced more than 1,000 new cases.
Although the school was better prepared than in the fall: “This is a variant that moves 50 percent faster than anything we had to deal with last semester,” said Emily Toth Martin, an associate professor of epidemiology who devised the campus testing program.
And since the spring semester started, other colleges across the country have also struggled with emerging variants, among them: the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Miami, Tulane and the University of California, Berkeley.
Even before variants emerged in the United States at the end of the year and in January, by early December, The New York Times had already linked more than 397,000 cases and at least 90 deaths to campuses since the pandemic's start.
Ahead of the spring semester, the University of California, San Diego, planned to bring an additional 1,000 students to campus housing, the University of Florida to up the number of in-person classes offered and Princeton to increase its on-campus living student population to thousands of undergraduates from a few hundred. Almost two times the number of students would return to Harvard — and make that almost three times to Brown. And Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., wasn't just increasing the number of students on campus, it planned to reopen study abroad, too. (On the other side of the argument, California State University’s 23 campuses planned to be mostly remote this spring.)
Far from everyone was happy about the reopenings. Faculty members at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill voiced their concerns about in-person classes in an open letter: “We have every reason to expect that the university will — once again — be overwhelmed by infections when classes resume,” they wrote, asking the university to cancel most in-person classes in the spring. 
More than 200 professors at the University of Florida asked for reprieves from teaching students face to face — less than half were given permission to do so. 
And State University of New York at Oneonta in upstate New York announced it would reopen for in-person classes in the spring — to a voluminous petition in protest. In the fall, the school, which suffered the worst outbreak of any public college in the state, had not mandated negative tests before students returned to campus (although many schools in the college system asked students for test results). That changed in the spring, and students have also been required to complete a daily health questionnaire for the 14 days before they came to campus and to quarantine for seven days before arriving. They are also subjected to weekly pooled surveillance testing.
Yes, money is, of course, a factor in the decision to bring students back. (Colleges make a lot, charging for room and board.) But actually, some studies suggest it’s not a bad approach because oftentimes cases aren’t traced back to in-person classes anyway — the biggest risk is the social activities college students like to engage in after class. In fact, a study of 70,000 undergraduates at Indiana University suggested that the more classes a student took in person, the lower the likelihood that student would become infected with Covid-19. But that was before the variants appeared on campus, which could affect how schools adjust going forward.
Of course, not everyone will adjust the same. So far, colleges have adapted a patchwork of policies of varying strength and effectiveness to combat outbreaks on campus. At times the gaps have put students and faculty at risk. In fact, although the American College Health Association's guidelines suggest testing college students twice a week in order to detect asymptomatic infections, it is unknown how many colleges have gone ahead and adopted this research-backed approach.
Separately, college students are becoming frustrated with fees and loans that don’t seem worth the virtual education. Students at the University of Georgia and at Georgia Tech are suing to get some of their tuition and fees back. Community colleges are enrolling fewer and fewer male students — especially among students of color. (Right now, you shouldn't have to pay anything toward your student loans — or accrue interest — through the end of September. And you won't need to pay income taxes on that forgiven debt, either for any debt forgiven from the start of this year through the end of 2025. For more info, see this Q. and A. with the Education Department.)
It’s not an easy time. Last year colleges asked Congress to pass a bill with $120 billion in relief for higher education. The third stimulus package puts almost $40 billion toward higher education.

Tracking the Coronavirus Across U.S. Campuses",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
631,Why are my younger kids in the classroom and the older ones still at home?,"Schools should be the last to close and the first to reopen, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (But that hasn't happened anywhere.)
And for no one is that more important than for our youngest students, because: 1. They really need that in-person instruction more than the older kids, and 2. It’s safer for them to be in the classroom.
In February, the C.D.C. urged schools K-12 to reopen as soon as possible, while emphasizing the particular importance of getting younger children back in their desks. (The C.D.C. also said that vaccinating teachers should be a priority but not a prerequisite for reopening, which follows New York's statistics, as well.)
“C.D.C.’s operational strategy is grounded in science and the best available evidence,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the C.D.C.   
Younger children — those under 10 — are less likely to contract and transmit the virus, so they can enter the classroom at a much lower risk than older students. 
Plus, many health experts, say classrooms are rather safe, so long as schools enforce safety measures like mask wearing and social distancing.
Elementary students can safely receive at least some in-person learning in communities with high transmission rates, according to the C.D.C. And taking those children out of the classroom should only be in the most extreme circumstances (and even then, they should be on a hybrid model with some in-person instruction). Meanwhile, older students can safetly attend if their community has lower transmission rates, or if, amid higher rates, their schools enforce weekly testing of students and staff to weed out asymptomatic infections. But, the C.D.C. notes, those students may have to return to hybrid or remote learning in those cases, and at the highest transmission rates, these classrooms should shutter. (Additionally, the C.D.C. urged prioritizing in-person instruction over other school activities — like sports, clubs.)
Of course, it's safest for everyone if local governments do the work to tamp down their numbers — and parents might also be more comfortable sending their kids back. But across the country, city and state governments have prioritized the openings of nonessential businesses and other quickie-economic fixes over getting kids back in the classroom. And although the C.D.C.'s guidance is rooted in science, it has no enforcement mechanism. 
Sadly, that means that while the agency is pushing for the reopening of schools, its own criteria would keep more than 90 percent of U.S. counties from full-time classroom teaching, according to Dr. Walensky's own figures. 
The good news: Most public school districts across the country are providing at least some face-to-face teaching, although only about half of the country's students are learning in the classroom. The bad news: Poor students of color in urban districts are less likely to get that face time — often, their schools are still closed.
When many elementary students in New York City started back Dec. 7, they returned to classrooms with even more health precautions: random weekly testing and 10-day closures for every two unrelated positive cases detected in the school. (Individual classrooms also shutter with the detection of a single case.) As a result, between Jan. 4 and Feb. 10, more than half of the 1,052 open school buildings had been closed for up to two weeks, while less than 400 had not had to close at all in the new year. 
In February, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that about 62,000 New York City middle school students (those who last year opted for in-person learning) will return to the classroom for at least part of the week beginning Feb. 25 — the first time since November. (The two-case rule is not likely to change before they do.)
Mr. de Blasio also wants to reopen high schools this spring, too — but they're “a complex situation,” he said.
And aross the country, school districts have turned to New York, the nation's largest district, which has been leading the pack in reopening to determine the best course of action. Even so, by the time elementary students started back in New York, those in Michigan, Cambridge, Mass., and Johnson County, Kan., were already in class.

632,"With a vaccine rolling out, will school get easier?","Short answer: It should!! But, according to C.D.C. guidance in February, you shouldn't have to wait until your kid's teacher is vaccinated, anyway.
Of course, kids will have to wait longer than most of the rest of us to get vaccinated — although Pfizer's and Moderna's trials for kids over 12 have started. But kids aren’t the ones who are keeping the schools shuttered anyway. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says vaccinating students is “an extra added benefit,” but not necessary for reopening. 
Children rarely die after contracting the virus. In fact, young kids do not even pose a high risk of infecting others. 
The real hiccup in many places for school starting is protecting the adults in the building, although the C.D.C. says that while vaccinating teachers should be a priority, it is not necessary for safely reopening. New York's statistics support that assertion, although many teacher's unions across the country disagree and have stalled reopenings despite the guidance.
Carl Bergstrom, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Washington in Seattle, says that getting teachers vaccinated helps reduce cases among teachers as well as students and should be prioritized, but: “I can certainly see why they chose not to make it a prerequisite, because it may not be something that can be done in time to have schools open.”
While teachers are often among the first to get vaccinated — after health care workers and people living in long-term care facilities, many have still yet to be vaccinated and stalled roll-outs across the country leave many question marks as to when they realistically will be inoculated.
Even in places like Oregon, which have prioritized vaccinating teachers, concerns linger that it won't be enough to reopen schools there.
Of course, teachers aren’t the only adults at school. Bus drivers, cafeteria staff, custodians and receptionists are all critical to keeping a school running — and where they will fall in the vaccine line remains uncertain. 
“The equity angle is really important,” said Dr. Grace M. Lee, an associate chief medical officer for practice innovation at Stanford Children’s Health. “All of the folks that enable a school to open are going to be critical to that work force.”

634,When does the extra $300 start coming and how long will it last?,"That extra $300 will continue coming in with the rest of your unemployment — until Sept. 6.
Now, if you're separately worried about eligibility for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, be assured that that extra $300 will not mean the difference in calculating either.
Now, if you earn a mixed income of self-employment and wages from other employers and have been quashed into a lower state-issued benefits based on your lower wages, then you'll get an extra $100 weekly payment, called the mixed-earner supplement — again through Sept. 6. (But that money will be calculated in your eligibility for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program.

635,I’m trying to exercise again. It’s really hard. Tips?,"Over all, our excercise habits have changed considerably during the course of the pandemic. A study from the U.K., which had not been peer-reviewed, showed than many of us have been less active since the start of lockdowns, although some people have really upped their routines — and many of those people are over 65. No matter where you are on that scale, it's never too late to get started.
Let's just get this out of the way up front: If you are healthy and do not have a breathing ailment, then, no, wearing a mask should not affect your ability to workout, and, yes, you should be wearing one — still.
Two studies — one published out of Israel and the other out of Canada — and both focused on cycling, find that masks don't negatively affect vigorous workout routines. People's heart rate and respiration changed negligibly. (That's right, it's in your head.) And, no, it doesn't matter what your mask is made of.
“From the results of our study, I don’t think masks are likely to make workouts feel worse,” said Philip Chilibeck, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, who oversaw the Canadian study.
That said, wearing a mask can take some getting used to, so you might want to take it slower while you figure it out. (The studies showed that after a period of acclimation, you'd feel like the workout was essentially the same level of difficulty as without a mask.) But you should find the mask that feels best while working out (and it might not be the one you use to walk the dog). Also, an N-95 mask isn't suggested, as it ups your carbon dioxide levels. 
Now, if you’ve had Covid-19, expect a long recovery, and please take your time returning to exercise.
Even if you were an athlete beforehand, you are not going to be back at your peak capacity for a while. And the usual return-to-play criteria for sick athletes do not apply, said Dr. James Hull, a sports pulmonologist at Royal Brompton Hospital in London. 
“We have seen people have some mild symptoms to start with and seem to improve,"" he said, “only to then deteriorate really badly at seven days following their first symptoms.""
And no matter what, most everyone took some time off their normal workout routine in the early part of the lockdown, and many have struggled to hit stride with a routine that fits this new pandemic world. In other words, a lot of people are a lot less toned than they used to be. 
If you are one of those people, start slow. Even just taking an ""awe walk"" — conscientiously noting the beauty all around you (at whatever pace feels comfortable) will make you feel happier and more rejuvenated than if you, well, didn't. 
Focus first on strength, rather than cardio, because inactivity eats away at muscle mass. But take your time as you return to weight training, said Brad Schoenfeld, an associate professor of exercise science at Lehman College in New York, who researches resistance exercise. “If you have been doing almost no training,"" he said, “plan to start at 50 percent of the volume and intensity of your prior workouts"" when you return to the barbells. (And if you plan to head back to the gym, be sure to check out our question ""How about gyms?"" for safety tips.)
As you get back into your routine, you can add in cardio. But remember, even if you’re running outside, wear a mask. You’re breathing heavily, and you could be spitting out — or sucking in — virus droplets. (I know, yuck, right?) And while you might not be hitting the same mileage as before (or you may be a little slower), that's okay. You'll get it back ... one step at a time.

636,I miss looking at art. What do I do?,"A recent visit to New York's empty Met felt ripped from the pages of ""From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler"" — and while no one was actually spending the night in the museum alone with the artwork, there was a particular feeling of closeness, like the art might actually come alive when all the people were gone.
In Paris, the Louvre is still closed. In Madrid, the Prado is open. And in New York, museums including the Met have been open since August, despite a temporary case surge over the winter, while museums in Los Angeles, which has been hard hit by the pandemic, have been shuttered almost a year. (In March, some museums in the Bay Area began reopening, with decreasing case rates indicating that others in California might also soon begin welcoming visitors.)
But if you still aren't comfortable visiting a museum, or one in your area isn't yet open, you can get your art fix — virtually, of course. And why stop at one museum when you can dive into your favorite rooms (and maybe a few yet unexplored) scattered all over the world? (Of course, it's not the real thing, but by zooming in, you can “get up close"" to the surface of canvases in a way that you might never have been able to before.) 
First stop: New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art for a 360-view of the Cloisters and the Temple of Dendur. Then skip that walk down Fifth Avenue and click on the Frick, with a virtual map letting you move through rooms and explore your favorite masterpieces up close. 
Then head south of the border to visit Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico City. The afternoon is promised to be sunny, as you pass through the open home. 
Next, sneak into Europe — Starting on the streets of Barcelona, for a walk-through of some of Gaudí's most incredible archeological wonders, starting with his famous cathedral, La Sagrada Familia, continuing on with Casa Batlló, and, finally spending a bit of time at Park Güell. Then over to Madrid for some close-up time with some of the Prado's greats: El Greco, Velázquez and Goya. 
Hop over to Paris for a virtual Louvre experience, complete with a private viewing of the Mona Lisa. And be sure to dip into Musée de l'Orangerie for a full immersion in Monet's waterlilly garden (without all those other people crowded around you).
Then jet over to Upper Egypt and wonder at the ornate depictions scaling the columned walls of the Red Monastery and drop by Dubai's Al Fahidi Fort. Finally end in Japan, at the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, scanning through more than 150 pieces of Asian modern and contemporary art.
Not sure where to go first? The Arts section ran a series of reviews of some virtual shows.
And remember, just because you're not buying a ticket for entry, doesn't mean you can't make a contribution to your local museum. These days some of our favorite art insitutions are struggling to balance budgets and keep staff amid diminished capacities, so if you have a little money to spare consider giving it to the museum that welcomed you through its virtual doors — isn't Picasso that much better in sweatpants from the comfort of your couch?

637,Is it coronavirus or the common cold?,"It’s inevitable. In the fall and winter your child is likely to develop a fever, runny nose or cough. Maybe even all three. (Or, if you're like me, you'll be laying prostrate on the couch for two weeks, sure that Covid-19 has finally caught up with you, only to learn you just have a cold.) Yep, it happens even to the best of adults, too.
That said, don't assume either way. If you feel bad, you should stay home, call a doctor, schedule a Covid-19 test — and nestle down with some O.J. and Netflix as far from the rest of the people in your home as you can. (Especially if you have high-risk family members.)
“This is not the year to just send your kid to school,"" said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and assistant dean at Brown University. “This is the year to respect the community and get your kid tested before sending them back.""
You likely won’t know if it’s the coronavirus or a common cold because the symptoms are so similar. And that means: no going to work or school when you're feeling sick. (You shouldn't have before, but now you really, really shouldn't.) And no going back until you're feeling better — and have a negative test to prove it. 
Research suggests your kids can be asymptomatic but still contagious. (So if they have symptoms — even sniffles or an upset tummy — play it extra safe.)
A chart on the C.D.C.’s website shows just how often these symptoms can overlap.
If you think your child has been exposed, get a test. 
“We have seen, time and time again, kids with very mild symptoms with no known exposures who get tested with our very accurate P.C.R. and sure enough, they come back positive,” said Dr. Stanley Spinner, chief medical officer and vice president of Texas Children’s Pediatrics, the largest pediatric primary care group in the country, and Texas Children’s Urgent Care.
And never mind the struggles of getting your kid to calm down enough to be tested, pediatric tests may be hard to come by in and of themselves. So don’t assume that your local pharmacy will also swab your kid. Call ahead. 
And if your kid has a preference for test type, be sure to specify before you confirm. You'll want to ask if they use the short (anterior) swab — it's supposedly more comfortable and certainly less intimidating — or the long (nasopharyngeal) swab. If the place where you're scheduling your appointment does not offer the test you prefer, you can try other neighborhood testing locations, including pediatric urgent care centers.
Molecular tests, like the P.C.R. tests are best for detecting infection in your children, and rapid tests may not be very accurate for them anyway; there just isn't data showing us that they really work for our kids. (Which sort of defeats the purpose of getting that uncomfortable test, no?)
And before you go, check out these tips for what to expect. Also watch this video — having some answers and understanding the process will help calm down your kid, or any other members of your household disinclined to a nose probe.

638,Can I expect another stimulus payment?,"Yes, you can! For those with a Social Security number, the third stimulus package provides a bit more: $1,400 per person — but for about nine million fewer households. 
The measure ensures $1,400 checks to individuals earning $75,000 or less, heads of household with an adjusted income of no more than $112,500 and couples filing jointly earning no more than a combined $150,000, with diminishing payments for higher salaries up to the specified caps. (If you’re eligible you’ll also receive the same amount for each of your children.) 
The income cap will be $20,000 less than before, and while those earning just above the threshhold would receive a partial check. But that drops to zero quickly: Any individual earning more than $80,000 (heads of household earning over $120,000 or households exceeding $160,000) will not receive any check. And that goes for the kids, too.
Now, if you still count your college kid as a dependent, they will get a check, too (unlike last time), as well as live-in elderly relatives.
Now, if you find yourself disqualified for payments because you made a lot more in 2019 than you did last year, when you file your 2020 tax return, you will be able to claim the money as a refundable tax credit.

639,When and how should I expect the next stimulus payment to come through?,"Some of you may have received that last round of payments from the I.R.S. within a few days. Some of us, well, didn't. (If you're still waiting, check the next two questions for what to do.)
On the whole, earlier rounds of payments are a good measuring stick: Under the CARES Act, people started receiving direct deposits two weeks after the legislation was approved — while those receiving the money by another method (an actual check or prepaid benefit cards) often waited much longer.
Then for the second round, the Treasury Department started making direct deposit payments before the end of the year and planned to start sending checks by Dec. 30. 
And, yes, just like before, many of us will be receiving direct deposits for this third round of payments. So if you want to avoid the extra lag time, be sure that the I.R.S. has your bank account information on file through the I.R.S.'s Get My Payment tool, which will let you track the status of your payment the way you would the delivery of a package. (Of course, a lot of people are checking, so it’s a practice in patience for sure.)

640,I still haven’t even gotten (all of) my earlier payments.,"The I.R.S.’s online tracker says that all payments have been made at this time, so if you still haven't gotten your first or second round of payments (or didn't get as much as you expected), then you're looking at a tax rebate instead. 
That means — even if you don't usually file a tax return — you'll need to do so this year. Go here for more information from the I.R.S. about what you need to know to receive your economic impact payment. 
Then head here to claim the recovery rebate credit on your 2020 tax return. (Specifically, that's Line 30 of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.)

641,Can children get the coronavirus? Can they transmit it?,"While there is no evidence that dogs or cats can spread the coronavirus to other humans, we can pass it on to our pets. So, if you are sick with Covid-19, don't pet your dog or anyone else's for that matter. (Additionally, an experiment confirmed that cats can spread the virus to each another, while dogs do not shed the virus.)
In April, a dog in North Carolina tested positive for the coronavirus, as did two pet cats in New York as well as eight tigers at the Bronx Zoo. The animals showed mostly mild symptoms — though a tiger was “visibly sick"" — and have recovered. 
More recently in December several snow leopards at the Louisville Zoo tested postive for Covid-19, as did a cougar and tiger at a Texas facility in February.
In Denmark, a disturbing mutation was reported in the fall as the virus switched between humans and mink. While the mutations were not more severe or transmissable than before, one of the variants, found in at least a dozen people, was less responsive to antibodies in lab tests. Mink,  which have been decimated by the virus and are among the only animals known to have passed the coronavirus to humans (there was also an early spillover from an unknown species), may even be in line  to get vaccinated, too.
With all that in mind, be safe, but don't forget man's best friend: take care of your animal’s mental health — this is stressful for them, too. Staying at home for months on end can acclimate your dog to an unrealistic reality, experts say. And if you're still working from home and spending most of your days there, start leaving for a bit, even to walk (without the dog), so they get used to the idea that you won’t always be around.  
And if you know someone is sick and has pets, check in on them. Some animals are being left behind by this virus.

So You're Worried About Covid and Your Pets: This Study has Some Answers",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-tips-advice.html,en,Answers to Your Current Coronavirus Questions - The New York Times
642,What about a coronavirus vaccine for kids?,"The short answer: Not until (at least) the end of the summer — if things go well.
The vaccine process for children is behind that of adults, because the purpose of the vaccine is to save lives. It needed to be tested in the most at-risk populations first, and older people are dying at a much higher rate from Covid-19 than children. People under the age of 21 make up about one-quarter of the country's population, but not even 1 percent of deaths from Covid-19. (That said, about 2 percent of children who get Covid-19 wind up in the hospital, and at least 227 children in the United States have died from the virus.)
Additionally, only if researchers discovered no serious side effects in adults, would they be able to start testing a vaccine in children, beginning with teenagers and working their way to younger ages. Vaccine developers are keenly aware that children are not simply miniature adults. Their biology is different in ways that may affect the way vaccines work.
Here's where we are now: 
-The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for anyone at least 16 years old, although there are ongoing trials for adolescents ages 12 to 15 — a crucial age group, as teenagers are almost twice as likely to get Covid as younger children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results are expected by summer, and a new study will be conducted for kids under 12, according to Keanna Ghazvini, a spokeswoman for Pfizer.
-The Moderna vaccine (also authorized for adults in December), that month began testing adolescents 12 to 17, with results expected around summertime, according to Colleen Hussey, a spokeswoman for Moderna. Following those results, the company plans to roll out another study looking at children ages 6 months to 11 years.
And here's some good news while we wait: getting your kid vaccinated won't be a prerequisite to opening schools back up in the fall, although it will be helpful for making close-contact extracurriculars (soccer teams, band practice, ballet class) safer.
As for new mothers who have just given birth, we've got some promising news (for some of you): while infants have rather weak immune systems, possibly making them more susceptible to infection if community transmission is high, infants born to vaccinated or infected mothers may come into the world with the antibodies already in their systems. Even so, this maternal protection will not likely last through a baby's first birthday.
Getting your kid vaccinated (once a vaccine is available) will be incredibly important, not just for your child's health, but for getting us all on track to reach herd immunity, when we'll all start feeling the protections that come when the virus can't find any targets because most of us have already been immunized. That magic number now appears to be anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of the population — meaning kids have to take part.
And in the interim, check in with your kid's pediatrician to make sure they're up-to-date on all those other vaccines and boosters. With time warped this past year, you may have forgotten, and stats from the Vaccines for Children Program suggest you're not alone: There have been some 10 million fewer ordered doses of non-flu vaccines. Yep, that's the big ones, so while you're waiting on that Covid vaccine, check in on measles, HPV, tetanus and pertussis. (No need for any new outbreaks in 2021.)

643,I am an undocumented Oregon resident. Can I be tested for COVID-19 or seek medical treatment for COVID-19 and get coverage through the emergency-only coverage (CAWEM)?,"You can still see a doctor if you don’t have medical insurance. This includes care in the emergency room, at community and migrant health centers, free clinics, and public hospitals. 
If you have CAWEM, CAWEM plus, OHP,
or private insurance, you won’t be charged for a test or treatment for COVID-19, including going to the hospital. 
The Governor has reached an agreement with insurers so that people will not have to pay anything out of pocket for COVID-19 tests or hospitalizations from COVID-19.
If you are undocumented or have been a legal permanent resident (green card holder) for less than 5 years, you may be eligible for the Oregon Health Plan’s (OHP) Citizen/Alien Waived Emergency Medical (CAWEM) benefit which includes emergency medical, dental and transport services including services at a hospital emergency room and being
hospitalized if needed. CAWEM also includes all services for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. This coverage is not limited to emergency rooms and hospitals. OHA can reimburse providers for COVID-19-related services regardless of service location. Coverage includes non-emergency settings such as medical offices and urgent care.

The receipt of emergency Medicaid, such as CAWEM, cannot be counted under U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service’s (USCIS) public charge rule. Additionally, on March 13, 2020 USCIS issued an alert on its website stating​ that the agency will not consider testing, treatment, or preventive care (including vaccines, if a vaccine becomes available) related to COVID-19 as part of a public charge determination. You should seek the medical treatment or preventive services you need to protect your health and the health of others. This includes if your care is paid for in whole or in part by Medicaid, also known as the Oregon Health Plan. 
If you do not have Oregon Health Plan (OHP) coverage or Citizen/Alien Waived Emergency Medical (CAWEM), you can apply for it here​. If you don’t want to sign up for OHP because of the public charge rule, you can see a clinician through your county health clinic or through a federally qualified health clinic (FQHC). If you have any important medical, mental health or medication needs be sure to mention this when you call.

645,How can I manage my stress and anxiety about COVID-19?,"During this time of increased stress, it’s important to
prioritize your mental well-being. Our lives have been disrupted in ways both
large and small. Be gentle with yourself, adjust your expectations and allow
yourself time to get used to the new normal. 
It’s OK if you are struggling to adapt or if you are feeling
fearful or sad. These are natural reactions to an unusual situation. If you
feel this way, reaching out to others can help. Try to build some social
connection into your regular routine – it’s best not to wait for sadness or
loneliness to set in, since sometimes that can make it harder to reach out. 
You can help others while you help yourself: check in regularly with friends and neighbors
to offer support, especially to those who might be struggling more during this
time.
Older adults, people who experience disabilities, parents
with young children, and those living with mental health or substance abuse
challenges might be feeling especially isolated right now. If there is someone
in your life who you think might need a little extra connection, reach out to
them.
It’s natural to struggle with feelings of sadness,
frustration, fear, or anxiety during this time of increased isolation. Some
additional tools that some have found helpful to cope with these feelings
include:
Guided
relaxation, meditation, or mindfulness exercises  
Physical exercise
Writing in a journal
Creative expression like singing or making music, creative
writing, or 
Creating artwork

660,What can I do to help my child?,"Keep
your children safe. Lock up guns and medications even if you trust your child or teen and feel they are safe. It only takes a moment for someone to hurt themselves in a temporary moment of despair or anger.
Remember,
children follow the lead of their parents. They look to you to see if they
should be afraid, concerned, confident, calm or carefree. You can set the stage
for their response to be concerned and confident by taking a moment to check in
with yourself before you check in with them. 
Consistency
and structure can help establish a sense of normalcy and be calming. 

Try to establish a simple routine for your
family in 60- or 90-minute chunks.
Get your children involved in the planning
process to give them a sense of control. 
Consider including routine mealtimes and
consistent bedtimes and wake up times.
Physical activity has been shown to combat symptoms of anxiety and depression.
Taking regular breaks to go outside for fresh
air and exercise is great for mental health.
Look for free online resources for
youth-focused at-home workouts, such as Fitness Blender Kids Workout - 25
Minute Fun Workout for Kids at Home.

Relearn
how to be present with your family. 

Being present and available for your family
can be the best way to support and help during this stressful time. 
Consider working on tasks or projects
alongside your children and set aside time to offer your family your full and
undivided attention.

Maintain
technologic well-being:

The key to healthy screen use is awareness and
open conversations with your children. 
Consume news judiciously from reputable

provider thinks you may have COVID-19, he or she will first determine if you
are well enough to stay home or if you need to go to a clinic or hospital. Healthcare
providers may also work with local public health to arrange for testing for the
virus. 
Testing​ will likely involve:

A nose swab and throat swab.
A routine blood sample.
Coughing up mucus, if possible.



If you are
seen in a clinic or hospital, your health care provider may ask you to:

Put on a mask to limit spread of the virus.
Make sure you are not around other people.


Care
providers may:

Show you to a private room.
Put on equipment to protect themselves such as:
gowns,
gloves,
eye protection, and
s​pecial masks.






There is no
specific treatment for COVID-19. The goal is to support the person who is ill,
supply oxygen if needed, and help lessen the symptoms until the immune system
kicks in and kills the virus. Most people with COVID-19 appear to have mild
disease that doesn’t require a medical visit. 
As with flu, most people can recover at home without problems. Those
with fever and cough who get significant trouble breathing, or feel faint, or parents
of a child who gets bluish color of the skin around the mouth should call promptly
and arrange for medical evaluation or call 911.
If you are
tested for COVID-19, staff from your local health department will call you.

Health experts recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home. Employees should not come to work if they have:
Fever (100.4° F [38° C] or greater using an oral thermometer).
Other symptoms like cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.
People should be without fever or cough for 72 hours without using fever reducing medicines like aspirin or acetaminophen before returning to work or school. This applies to everyone, not just people that have been tested for COVID-19.
Employees should inform their supervisor and stay home if they are sick.
Separate sick employees from other employees.
This is what CDC recommends. Also, those with fever or acute respiratory illness symptoms should go home immediately:
Upon arrival to work, or
During the day, if symptoms develop while at work.
Help your workplace stay healthy.
Emphasize that all employees should:
Stay home when sick, and make sure workplace policies allow sick
leave so that people can do the right thing by protecting their co-workers.
Cover their coughs and sneezes.
Wash their hands frequently.
For more information visit these CDC websites:

Perform regular cleaning of the workplace. Make it a routine to clean all surfaces that people often touch. Examples are workstations, countertops and doorknobs. Use cleaning agents usually used in these areas and follow the directions on the label.
Know how to respond to employees after exposure or who are sick.
Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should:
Tell their supervisor.

breathe in droplets made when ill people cough, sneeze or talk. This can happen
when someone is close to a sick person, within six feet. Rarely, people might
catch COVID-19 by touching a surface that a person with the infection coughed
or sneezed on, and then touching their own mouth, nose or eyes. Coronaviruses
can’t survive for long on surfaces, though, so this isn’t common.",https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/COVID19-FAQ.aspx?wp1284=l:100,en,Vaccine FAQs

676,How can I keep my child safe?,"Keep
your children safe. Lock up guns and
medications even if you trust your child or teen and feel they are safe. It only takes a moment for someone to hurt
themselves in a temporary moment of despair or anger. 
For those who
experience or are at risk of experiencing suicidal thoughts:

​Restrict access
to lethal means in your household - it has been proven to save lives!
​Keep
over-the-counter and prescription medications in a medication lockbox or locked
cabinet.
Ensure firearms
are kept in a gun safe with a trigger lock and store ammunition separately.
Alcohol and other
mind-altering substances can impair judgement and lower inhibitions.
​Consider removing
these from the home or keeping them in a locked cabinet.
Sharps such as
knives, razor blades, and scissors are frequently used to engage in
self-injurious behaviors.
Limit access to
these items when youth are unsupervised.
Develop a safety
plan with your child, such as this one: Patient
Safety Plan Template.
Discuss warning
signs, coping strategies, and healthy activities that can distract your child
from thoughts of self-harm when they do occur.
Have a list of
names and contact information that your child can reach out to for distraction
or help when needed.
Entirely removing
access to technology as a consequence can be very isolating for your child.
​Cutting off a
lifeline to a teen’s friends can result in an emotional backlash and disruption
in the parent-child relationship.
When a lapse in
judgement is related to phone use, ask your child about the behavior and
consider limited privileges targeted to the problematic behavior.
Aim to teach your
children to manage their own relationship with technology.

686,What is the difference between the roles of the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL) and commercial laboratories?,"In a public health emergency, the role of OSPHL is to begin laboratory testing before commercial labs can test and perform laboratory testing for prioritized populations. As a lower-volume laboratory, OSPHL bridges the gap between emergence of new infections, such as COVID-19, and availability of testing through commercial laboratories. OSPHL also supports testing for vulnerable populations. As more commercial laboratories begin testing, OSPHL may begin to support public health by conducting testing for surveillance purposes rather than direct patient care.
Commercial laboratories now offer expanded capacity for clinicians to order COVID-19 testing at their discretion. Local health systems have started to offer testing in their laboratories, further expanding testing capacity. Collecting samples for commercial lab testing can be done in the outpatient setting if clinically indicated. This testing is based on clinical judgment. It does not require public health approval. Clinic administrators may need to contact commercial labs to set up testing protocols for their clinics.",https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/COVID19-FAQ.aspx?wp1284=l:100,en,Vaccine FAQs

Oregon’s testing priorities are as follows:
Test
every Oregonian who is symptomatic even if the symptom is mild. 
Test
asymptomatic individuals in group living situations where COVID-19 is suspected
such as nursing homes, adult foster homes, group homes, farmworker housing,
fishing boats, prisons, and more. 
Conduct
widespread, voluntary sample testing, particularly for at-risk populations.

Never put a mask or face covering on an infant or an adult that is not able to adjust or remove the mask themselves. This could compromise their ability to breath.
The use of cloth face coverings may reduce the spread of virus and help prevent those who have the virus but do not have symptoms from passing it to others. Still, the most effective means of preventing the spread of COVID-19 is staying home and avoiding all
non-essential contact with others.
If you are sick:
You should wear a facemask when you are around other people and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office.

others healthy.
Medical masks should be reserved for health care providers who are on the front lines working with patients who are most likely to have COVID-19.
People who are ill with fever and a cough might have a cold, the flu or any number of other diseases, or they may have COVID-19. They should wear a surgical mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19 germs to others.

707,Have there been changes related to Oregon Health Plan members or people who need coverage?,"If you have the Oregon Health Plan and need to be tested
for novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it’s covered. If you are hospitalized because
of COVID it’s covered.
The 3/31 Oregon Medicaid waiver includes the following:
OHP
members will not lose or have a reduction in benefits during the COVID-19
crisis. There are a few exceptions to this rule and those are: 
Moving
out of state for a reason not related to COVID-19 
Request by member to close benefits 
Incarceration 
Deceased 
Aged out
Current OHP members will not lose coverage during this
crisis. This includes Cover all Kids coverage that is a state-funded only
benefit, unless they turned 19 years old and aged out of the program and will
be enrolled in CAWEM. 
You can apply for OHP without having to verify income
(submit a pay stub) with your application. You can self-attest, which will help
you get access to OHP coverage more quickly. 
Sign up at ONE.Oregon.gov​ – you may be eligible for OHP even if you have been denied in the past. 
Federal stimulus payments and increased unemployment
payments will not affect OHP eligibility. They will not be counted during the
application process or when members report a change in their household income. 
If you don’t want to apply for OHP, we encourage you
to see a clinician through your county health clinic or through a federally qualified health clinic (FQHC).",https://www.oregon.gov/oha/PH/DISEASESCONDITIONS/DISEASESAZ/Pages/COVID19-FAQ.aspx?wp1284=l:100,en,Vaccine FAQs

750,How does COVID‑19 spread?,"COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, especially between people who have been in close contact, or within 6 feet, of each other. An infected person with or without symptoms may spread the virus to others. When an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes, droplets from their mouth can spread through the air and land in the mouths or noses of nearby people or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), COVID-19 can sometimes be spread by smaller droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours. This kind of spread is called airborne transmission. COVID-19 can also spread by a person touching a surface or object that has virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. For the most up-to-date information, see the How COVID-19 Spreads section of the CDC website. CDC is learning more about COVID-19 every day and will update this section of their website as more information becomes available.",https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/coronavirus/faq.aspx,en,Frequently Asked Questions | COVID-19

The Vermont Department of Health recommends any volunteers bringing items to those who need to stay home:


Keep a distance of 6 feet away.


Avoid entering the personâs home.


Wear a cloth face mask or covering.


Wash your hands regularly.


Avoid touching your face and cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Taking care of yourself, your friends, and your family can help you cope with stress. Helping others cope with their stress can also make your community stronger.


Take breaks from watching, reading, or listening to news stories, including social media. Hearing about the pandemic repeatedly can be upsetting.

756,How can I prepare at home?,"Plan ways to care for those in your home who might be at greater risk for serious complications, like older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions. Make sure those who need regular medicine, medical supplies and equipment have what they need.


Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy. Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.


Make sure you have enough groceries and other supplies for 14 days in case you get sick and need to quarantine. Stock up on only what you will need for 14 days. Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.


Get support from others. Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has Front Porch Forum, consider joining to connect with neighbors, information and resources. Stay in touch by phone or email with family and friends, especially those who are 65 years and older, who have underlying medical conditions, or who live alone.


Take care of the emotional health of your household members. Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.


Keep a daily list of other people you are in close contact with. As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

765,"What is serologic, or antibody, testing and will it be used in Vermont?","Serologic testing measures antibodies in the blood of a person who has been infected with COVID-19, whether they felt sick or not. In other words, it measures the bodyâs immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself.
With any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results â false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.
Though certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish âproof of immunity.â However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ

769,What is a PCR test?,"A PCR test is the most common type of COVID-19 test used today. PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction. The test identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus.
PCR tests are generally the most reliable tests. Samples are analyzed at a lab, which usually takes up to a few days. A PCR test is used at pop-up testing sites offered by the Health Department.
Data on COVID-19 activity reported by the Health Department includes only PCR tests.
The PCR test used by the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory has a sensitivity rate of 95%, which means the test correctly gives a positive result 95% of the time. Sensitivity rates may be different at other labs.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ

you have had no fever for at least 24 hours without the use medicine that reduces fevers AND
other symptoms have improved (for example, when your cough or shortness of breath have improved) AND
at least 10 days have passed since your symptoms first appeared

If you did not have any symptoms, you can leave home and be with others after:

10 days have passed since the date you had your positive test (unless otherwise instructed by your health care provider).

Your health care provider will follow CDC guidelines. In all cases, follow the guidance of your health care provider and the Health Department. The decision to stop home isolation should be made in consultation with your health care provider and the Health Department.
After stopping home isolation, continue to follow the general precautions to help keep the virus from spreading:Â wear aÂ cloth face mask or covering, keep a 6-foot distance from others you donât live with, wash your hands often, and stay home if you are sick.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
774,Can I wear a face shield instead of a face mask or covering?,"As of August 1, you are required to wear a face mask or covering in public spaces in Vermont any time it is not possible to keep a 6-foot distance from others who are not part of your household. In private settings with people you donât live with, we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when itâs not possible to stay 6 feet apart. However, for some people, and in some cases, a face shield may be an option.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, by respiratory droplets released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus.
If you have trouble breathing or if you work in a setting where it is difficult to wear a face mask or covering, wearing a face shield is better than wearing nothing over your nose and mouth. People who have trouble breathing can also wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom. In school settings, students and adults are allowed to wear face shields, and in child care settings, providers, teachers and staff are allowed to wear face shields.
Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shieldâs headpiece. Clean them regularly â especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield â and handle them like face masks or coverings when putting them on or removing them.

776,How can I be safe from COVID-19 infection and prevent an overdose?,"Substance use may increase the risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19, but more evidence is needed. At the same time, an opioid overdose is an immediate risk to your life. Know that stimulants may also have fentanyl in them, an opioid. Below are some tips to help avoid an overdose or be better prepared if one happens and to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.
If you are alone:

Call, text or send a Facebook or other type of message to someone you trust. Tell them youâre going to use and make a safety plan. For example, ask them to call you in a certain number of minutes. If they donât hear from you, they should follow your plan. This could include coming over to check on you, calling a family member to check on you, or calling 911.
Call Never Use Alone at 800-484-3731 or message them on Facebook. Theyâll wait while you use and call for emergency services if you donât respond after a certain period of time.
Have Naloxone with you. Put it where someone checking on you will easily see it.
Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.

If youâre not alone:

Try to keep a 6-foot distance from the other people youâre with, unless you live with them. People who live in the same household donât need to stay 6 feet apart.
Anyone in the room should wear a face mask or covering if they are not using and not part of your household.
Make sure someone you trust has naloxone on hand, and they arenât using at the moment.
Let them know when you are using so they can check in and give naloxone if needed.
Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.

Whenever and wherever you use, these tips can help prevent an overdose:

Use one drug at a time (donât mix).
Know your tolerance. Use less if you havenât used in a while, or if youâve been sick, lost weight, or if something else has lowered your tolerance.
Test for fentanyl or assume there is fentanyl in your supply.
Start low and go slow. You can use more later.
Use in a lower risk way, like snorting instead of injecting or smoking.
Consider getting on medication assisted treatment (methadone, bupe, suboxone, etc.).
Call 802-565-LINK or go to VTHelplink to find a treatment center.

About wearing face masks or coverings:
Wearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. However, substance use can impact your breathing and wearing a mask can make it worse. Plus, if you canât take your own mask off (like if youâre nodding out), you shouldnât wear one. When using substances with other people, particularly opioids, you may choose to stay 6 feet apart and not wear masks.

787,How does being indoors with the windows closed affect my risk of getting COVID-19?,"Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus and becoming infected with it.
The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.
It is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.
In general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.
There is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you donât live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:

How big the space is â Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.
How many people are in the room or area â A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.
How much ventilation there is â Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air. If it is too cold outside to open windows, then setting up a fan to pull air out of the room can reduce your risk. However, using a fan to blow air into or around the room or using ceiling fans is not recommended since they could keep the virus in the air for longer.
How humid the room or area is - Coronaviruses thrive when the relative humidity is below 40%, which usually happens when buildings are heated during the fall and winter. If you can, run a humidifier to maintain a relative humidity of at least 40% in the room or area where people are gathering.
What the people are doing in the room or area â Places where people can continuously wear a mask (for example, a family gathering without food or drink or a library) are less of a risk than places where people might take their masks off (for example, dinner at a friendâs house or a restaurant).

Be sure to take these general precautions any time you are in an indoor environment, whether you are at home or in another building:

Stay home if you are sick.
Avoid crowded indoor spaces.
Wear a face mask or covering.
Keep a 6-foot distance from people you donât live with.
Wash your hands often.

788,How long can the virus live on surfaces?,"It is possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is not thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads. This can be prevented by washing your hands before you touch your face, mouth or eyes. The virus is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person.
If someone is sick with COVID-19, you should regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (for example, tables, countertops, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucet handles and sinks). Follow the steps for how to clean and disinfect your home from the CDC.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
789,Is it safe to wear gaiters instead of masks?,"Generally, we recommend face masks and coverings that are made of at least two layers. Materials with tighter weaves, like cotton T-shirt material, are better at trapping respiratory droplets and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus than materials with loose weaves, like gaiters.
If you choose to wear a gaiter as a face covering, fold it over so it is two layers. Based on a few experiments in adults, gaiters with one layer trap the least amount of respiratory droplets. Gaiters with two layers trap more droplets than gaiters with one layer. Gaiters folded over into two layers have a similar effectiveness at trapping respiratory droplets as two layers of cotton T-shirt material.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
790,How does COVID-19 spread?,"COVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact through respiratory droplets
COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are near each other (within about 6 feet).
When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. Another person can become infected if they inhale the droplets, or if droplets land in their nose or mouth.
COVID-19 can sometimes spread through airborne transmission
As the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.
It is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away.
This airborne transmission is uncommon, but has occurred in situations such as indoors when a person with COVID-19 had symptoms and been coughing for longer than 30 minutes. Other examples include shouting, singing or exercising, or being in a building without proper ventilation that allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.
COVID-19 spreads less commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces
Respiratory droplets can also land on surfaces and objects. It is possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is not thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads. This can be prevented by washing your hands before you touch your face, mouth or eyes.
Not everyone infected with the virus has symptoms.
Follow these general precautions to help prevent the virus from spreading:

Keep a 6-foot distance from people you donât live with.
Wear a face mask or covering when you canât keep 6 feet apart.
Avoid crowded indoor spaces.
Wash your hands often.
Stay home if you are sick.

797,"What are some ways I can talk about my COVID-19 ""comfort level"" when making plans with friends and family?","As life picks up again, we are learning there is a lot to discuss before seeing friends and family to feel comfortable and stay safe. Here are four tips to help have the âCOVID Talkâ â a conversation to negotiate boundaries and establish expectations ahead of time.

Ask questions. Before you get together, start with an open and honest conversation about what everyone has been doing to stay healthy and how they have been socializing. Consider everyoneâs worries, boundaries and possible COVID-19 exposure risk so you can all get on the same page.
Focus on what you need. Using âIâ instead of âyouâ statements helps people avoid feeling defensive or judged. In fact, blaming and shaming may actually increase push back and the likelihood of risk-taking behaviors. We recommend sharing what youâre comfortable with based on your own perspective instead of making demands of others.
Share why it is important to you. Share what level of risk works for you and why. It might be different for others. Some people feel comfortable taking on a moderate amount of risk in their lives. Others may not feel comfortable taking on any risk. Focusing on your own reasons for staying safe can help people to better understand and get on board.
Set boundaries and stick to them. We are all for keeping it friendly, open and non-judgmental â but that doesnât mean you have to skimp on your safety! Itâs OK to be clear and straightforward with what you need to feel safe and comfortable. Itâs also okay to decline invitations or leave situations that feel too risky. You should never have to feel bad or apologize for prioritizing your safety. Lead by example by sticking to what works for you and avoiding judgment.

804,What does close contact mean?,"Close contact means being within 6 feet, for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period, of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 during their infectious period. The infectious period starts two days before any symptoms began â or for people with COVID-19 who don't have symptoms, two days before they got tested â and continues until they are recovered.
Close contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a short period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.
Here are some examples:
Examples of close contacts:

You live in the same home.
You are intimate partners.
You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.
You had dinner together while the person was infectious.

Examples of not close contacts:

You were their cashier at the grocery store.
You were their server at a restaurant.
You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.
You were in front of the person in line at the store.
You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.

If you are identified as a close contact,Â you will be contacted. The notification could come from the Health Department, your employer, school, or health care provider, for example.Â TheyÂ will call you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time. They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. Learn how contact tracing for COVID-19 works in Vermont.

The Health Department will:

Contact the person who tested positive (or their parent/guardian), ask them questions about their recent activities and who theyâve been in close contact with, and give instructions on staying home.
Notify the school if the person who tested positive is associated with a school.
Schools do not need to take action if the Health Department determines that there is no risk of further spread at the school. For example, if the person with COVID-19 was not at school during their infectious period, there would not have been an opportunity to spread the virus to others at school.
Work closely with the school to identify close contacts at school (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) of the person who tested positive with COVID-19 during their infectious period.
Discuss next steps with school administration, including whether to temporarily close the classroom for in-person instruction. These decisions are made on a case by case basis. The Health Department will provide guidance based on a number of factors, including the level of community transmission, the number of students or staff infected, the status of contact tracing, the number of days the infectious person was at school, infection control policies and practices, the number and structure of classes, pods, or grades affected, and other opportunities for transmission, like extra-curricular activities.

The school will:

Close off any areas where the person spent longer than 15 minutes (like a classroom, gym, or a cafeteria) then clean and disinfect the areas.
Communicate with parents and staff about the situation.
Support the Health Departmentâs efforts by notifying people associated with the school who have been identified as close contacts. The school will provide them with Health Department guidance and information on quarantine and testing. Quarantine means staying home and away from other people for up to 14 days.
Make sure that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 stays home from school (isolation) until they can return. Find out what to do if you test positive for COVID-19.

817,What do I do if I believe I had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?,"When someone tests positive for COVID-19, the Health Department works with them to identify their close contacts. Generally, these are people you were within 6 feet of, for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period, during the time they were infectious (contagious).
If you are identified as a close contact, you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your childâs school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time. They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home.
If you receive a textÂ message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone whoÂ tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from aÂ Health Department Contact Tracer.Â Find out what you need to do if you are a close contact.
If you are not identified as a close contact, then you will not be called. While contact tracers work to identify all close contacts, all might not be identified. If you think that you might be a close contact but didn't get a call, you may take precautions by quarantining for 14 days since the last day you were in contact with that person, and get tested on day 7 or after if you have not had any symptoms.
If you are not a close contact of a person who tested positive, you can continue to follow the prevention steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:

Stay home if you are sick.
Wash your hands often.
Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.
Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.
Wear a mask anytime you are around people you donât live with.

818,What is contact tracing?,"Contact tracing is used to provide education, support and guidance to people who are diagnosed with an infectious disease. Itâs also used to identify people who have been in close contact with them, so they can take steps to stop the disease from spreading to others.
If you test positive for COVID-19, you will get a call from the Health Department. A trained public health worker, called a contact tracer, will give you guidance to stay home and away from other people until you recover. This stops the virus from spreading to other people. They will ask you questions about your symptoms, activities, and who you may have come into contact with during a specific period of time. This information is only used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Itâs important to answer the call and to answer questions as completely as possible to make sure everyone knows what steps to take to prevent further spread of the virus. Governor Scottâs Executive Order calls on Vermonters to comply with all contact tracing requests.
All restaurants and other businesses are keeping a 30-day log of employee and guest names and contact information in case contact tracing is needed.
Consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.
Currently, Vermont is not participating in the contact tracing notifications that are available on some cell phones. We are waiting to see how successful this service is in other states who are participating. If itâs proven to be effective, we will consider using it.

819,Are there any recommendations for older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age with underlying medical conditions?,"According to the CDC, the risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk, and is higher for people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions. Severe illness means that the person with COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they may even die.
If you are in one of these groups, take these extra precautions in addition to the COVID-19 prevention steps:

Stay close to home as much as possible. Traveling out of state is not recommended since the virus is still widespread in neighboring states and across the country.
Be aware of your surroundings. Choose outdoor settings over indoor settings. Pay attention to the size of the space, crowding, the number of people there, and if they are wearing face coverings and keeping a 6-foot distance.
Choose activities that donât require close contact. Minimize close contact while talking or doing anything that requires exertion, shouting or singing.
Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with

The CDC recommends other populations also take extra precautions, like pregnant people, people experiencing homelessness, and people with disabilities.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
820,"Why are rates used on the town map, and how are they calculated?","The rate of recent cases by town map reflects the rate of cases of COVID-19 among Vermont residents per 10,000 people, by town of residence, from the past two weeks. Rates are commonly used because they allow us to compare the number of cases across towns that have different population sizes.
To calculate the rate by town in the last two weeks, we take the number of cases reported in the last two weeks in a town and divide it by that townâs population. That number is multiplied by 10,000 people. This is the rate, or number of cases per 10,000 people.
Use the map to compare how prevalent COVID-19 is in a town over the past two weeks, relative to other towns. The map may help communities assess how their town is doing and take additional actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when necessary.
When looking at the town rates, please remember that having a lower rate of recent cases is not the same as âsafer.â We know the virus is in our communities, and we should continue to follow health guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19 â no matter where we live or where we visit.

The orders do not close roads, do not establish roadblocks or checkpoints, and do not require people to show their identification.
People may be out and about. Motor vehicles with Vermont and out-of-state registrations are allowed to operate.
There will be no motor vehicle stops and no people detained for questioning about their travel.

823,Are face masks or coverings required in Vermont?,"You are required to wear a face mask or covering in public spaces in Vermont. This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks), group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes), and other places where itâs not possible to stay at least 6 feet away from people you donât live with.
Face masks or coverings are not required when you are doing strenuous exercise or activities. They are also not required for â and should not be worn by:

Children under the age of 2
Anyone who has trouble breathing
Anyone who is unable to remove the face mask without assistance
Anyone who has a medical or behavioral reason for not wearing a face mask

If you have a medical or developmental condition or have trouble breathing, you are not required to show evidence or documentation of your condition.
Businesses and other entities may also post signage explaining their mask requirements and can deny entry or service to people who are not wearing a mask, including people who are not required to wear a mask. However, the business must provide another way for people who are unable to wear a mask to access the business (for example, offering curbside pick-up or delivery or other creative solution).
In private settings (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering anytime youâre around people you donât live with.
Wearing face masks or coverings helps keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.
In addition to wearing face masks or coverings, these are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:

Stay home if you are sick.
Wash your hands often.
Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.

In private settings (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a mask anytime you're around people you donât live with.
People with COVID-19 can spread the virus even if they donât have any symptoms. Masks protect others around you as well as offer some protection to you.
A mask must be worn properly to be effective and avoid spreading the virus:

Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting it on.
Put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.
Make sure it fits snugly against the side of your face.
Slip the loops over your ears or tie the strings behind your head.
Do not touch it when you are wearing it.
Remove it by handling only the ear loops or ties and fold the outside corners together.
Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately after removing it.

Wash your mask regularly and make sure itâs completely dry before using it again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate them for washing and have enough clean ones to wear.
During hot weather, if you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot, take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place. It is important that you stay at least 6 feet away from others whenever possible, especially when you are not wearing a mask.
During cold weather, change your mask when it becomes wet. Keep a spare mask to replace the wet one, and put the wet one in a plastic bag until you get home. If you need to wear a scarf, ski mask or balaclava, wear it over your mask. If you wear glasses, find a mask that fits closely over your nose or has a nose wire to help reduce fogging.
Wearing masks is one way we can help slow the spread of COVID-19 â in addition to staying at least 6 feet away from people you donât live with and other prevention steps.

If you do gather with people you donât live with, you should quarantine. Quarantine means staying home and away from other people for 14 days. The Health Department strongly encourages you to get tested as soon as possible after the gathering and then again on day 7. If you have not had symptoms of COVID-19, you have the option to get a PCR test on day 7 and end your quarantine with a negative test result.
If you are around other people, itâs safest to be outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of spreading or getting COVID-19.
Follow these general prevention steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:

Stay home if you are sick.
Wash your hands often.
Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.
Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.
Wear a mask anytime you are around people you donât live with.

There will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:

6-Foot Spaces: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?
Masks on Faces: Will people wear masks?
Uncrowded Places: Is there enough space for people to spread out?

Imagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more tips on preventing COVID-19.
Also, consider keeping a contact journal â a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.

827,What protections are in place for congregate care settings and long-term care facilities?,"The Health Department has contacted all long-term care facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and senior housing facilities proactively to review strategies to prevent COVID-19 infection and develop plans to respond immediately if an infection is identified. We complete an in-depth assessment by phone and provide guidance about personal protective equipment and other infection prevention and control recommendations. We continue to stay in touch for any technical assistance needs and additional questions.
If a case of COVID-19 is associated with a long-term care facility, an epidemiology team is quickly activated. They contact the facility to provide recommendations and infection control support. The team begins contact tracing to determine the source of the infection and how it may be spreading. They ask questions and collect information to help identify anyone the patient had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than 6 feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.) The team communicates with close contacts to ensure isolation and quarantine guidelines are being followed, which will differ depending on the type of setting.
Vermont is taking measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in certain types of group living facilities, including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, residential care homes, therapeutic community residences, residential treatment centers, correctional facilities,Â state psychiatric care facilities, and homeless shelters.
If a staff member or resident tests positive for COVID-19, facility-wide testing of staff and residents might be recommended in consultation with the Health Department. If facility-wide testing is recommended, the Health Department provides technical assistance to make sure that the facility is connected with testing resources and provides guidance on when additional rounds of testing should take place. The Health Department also works closely with the facility to provide infection control guidance and resources.
Additionally, many long-term care facilities are conducting ongoing staff surveillance testing. For related guidance, read the Long Term Care Guidance for Operations During COVID-19 Health Emergency from the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living (DAIL) and Testing Recommendations for Long-term Care Facilities from the Health Department.
There is a table showing active outbreaks in long-term care facilities, which is updated on Tuesdays and Fridays.

828,What is a âprobable caseâ?,"A case is considered âprobableâ if the person:

tested positive on an antigen test and has symptoms of COVID-19 or epidemiologic evidence, or
has symptoms of COVID-19 and is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case of COVID-19.

As of December 2, probable cases are included in the number of COVID-19 cases in Vermont.
As of January 4, deaths among probable cases are included in the number of COVID-19 deaths in Vermont. A death among a probable case is a person who:

meets the probable case definition and has COVID-19 listed as a cause or contributing condition on their death certificate or
has COVID-19 listed as a cause or contributing condition on their death certificate.

The Health Department follows the nationally recognized definition of COVID-19 cases, developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) in April 2020. Since then, the Health Department has tracked probable cases and taken the same public health actions as if they were a confirmed case (confirmed means the person tested positive on a PCR test).
This means that contact tracers conduct interviews with people who are considered probable cases, provide isolation guidance, and their close contacts are notified to quarantine. People who are considered probable cases are also encouraged to get a follow-up PCR test. If they test positive on a follow-up PCR test, they are only included once in the total case count.
The Health Department began including probable cases and deaths in counts to more accurately represent COVID-19 activity and because antigen testing in Vermont is increasing. Right now, this change does not impact hospitalization or testing data.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ

In situations where you cannot avoid close contact with someone with COVID-19, you should quarantine while the person you are caring for is sick. You should also quarantine for 14 days after they are able to end home isolation.
Quarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from other people. Quarantine means you need to stay home and away from other people for 14 days since the day you were potentially exposed. You should separate yourself from others and check yourself for symptoms.

843,How do I know if my symptoms are from the vaccine or sickness from COVID-19?,"It takes time for the vaccine to teach your body to fight COVID-19, so you may not be protected by the vaccine until a few weeks after your second dose. This is one of the reasons it is so important to continue prevention steps, like wearing a mask, keeping 6 feet apart, and washing your hands, even after youâve been vaccinated.
It may be hard to tell the difference between side effects from the vaccine and symptoms from sickness if you get infected with COVID-19 between vaccine doses. While everyoneâs reaction may be different, vaccine side effects usually start within 12 to 24 hours after your vaccination. They should go away within a few days.
If symptoms get worse or last longer than a few days, contact your health care provider. They should be able to suggest next steps and maybe a COVID-19 test. Getting the vaccine will not affect your COVID-19 test results.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ

Do not take pain relievers or allergy medication before you get the vaccine to avoid side effects or allergic reactions. Allergy medications do not prevent a serious allergic reaction. They may hide symptoms that would tell a health care provider to treat an allergic reaction. Pain relievers may limit the vaccine from making a strong immune response.
After your vaccine, you can take pain relievers for any side effects you may have from the vaccine to help you feel better.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ

853,Why do I need two doses of the vaccine?,"Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses, spaced about 3 to 4 weeks apart. We strongly recommend Vermonters get both doses for the highest level of protection from COVID-19.
Two doses of these vaccines are scientifically proven to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19. Since the beginning, we have followed the science. Participants in the clinical trials who did not receive both doses were not followed for a long period of time, so we do not know for sure how well or how long one dose will protect you.
A two-dose vaccine is not new. For some vaccines, like hepatitis B, shingles and HPV, two doses produce longer-lasting protection. While the first dose gets your immune system ready and offers some protection, the second dose boosts that protection by using your bodyâs new immune cells it created after the first dose. This âboosterâ increases the strength of your new antibody protection and makes it last longer.
Taking the full course of vaccine offers better protection against variants of the virus. In fact, being only partially vaccinated, for example getting only one dose of a two-dose vaccine, could increase the risk of vaccine-resistant variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. This is because the virus could be weakened with some antibody protection, but not stopped completely, creating the potential for the virus to mutate.
Some people experience stronger side effects after the second shot. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have equal doses in their first and second shots, but for some, stronger side effects are part of their bodyâs normal immune reaction to that âboostâ in protection. Common side effects reported were pain at the injection site, fever, chills, tiredness and headache. These side effects typically go away within a few days.
Whether you experience side effects or not, rest assured the vaccine is working to protect you, your family and your community.

854,How can I make my own cloth mask?,"Homemade cloth masks can be made using simple materials found in most homes, for example, an old t-shirt or bandanna and rubber bands or hair ties. Make your mask with two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric.
The CDC has instructions on how to make a mask in several different methods, including machine or hand-sewn, a no-sew method with a t-shirt and scissors, and a no-sew method with a bandana.
You are required to wear a mask in public spaces in Vermont. In private settings (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you a mask anytime you're around people you donât live with.

855,What can I wear if my health or work environment doesn't allow me to wear a cloth face mask or covering?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly throughÂ close contact, by respiratory droplets released when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.Â Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing them from droplets getting into their eyes. Masks or coverings, like a cloth mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus.
However, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier over your nose and mouth.
Make sure your face shield fits properly. Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shieldâs headpiece. Clean them regularly â especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield â and handle them like masks when putting them on or removing them.
People who have trouble breathing can wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom, or a face shield.
Outdoor workers who are doing strenuous work that causes heavy breathing are not required to wear a mask when it is hot outside. Workers should keep masks with them and wear them when they are not exerting themselves (for example talking, resting, or interacting with other co-workers or people). It is important that workers keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible, especially when they are not wearing a mask.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ

Pain, swelling or redness on the arm where you got the shot
Tiredness
Headache
Chills
Muscle or joint pain
Fever
Nausea or vomiting

858,Is one type of mask better than another? Is wearing two masks better?,"The most important thing to do is to wear a mask â period. Wearing a mask protects both you and the people around you from getting or spreading COVID-19.
There are several types of masks to choose from, including cloth, disposable, N95 and KN95.
According to the CDC, the most effective fabrics for cloth masks are:

tightly woven fabrics, such as cotton and cotton blends
breathable
two or three fabric layers

You can also wear a disposable mask, like a surgical or medical procedure mask, instead of a cloth mask, now that they are in greater supply. These masks may provide some additional protection.
The CDC has found that âdouble maskingâ or wearing two masks (disposable mask underneath and a cloth mask on top) can offer a better fit and provide extra protection.
Typically N95 masks should be reserved for health care workers who are at highest risk and need them most. KN95 masks are also available for the public to purchase, but make sure the mask has been approved by the Food & Drug Administration.
Whichever mask you choose, it is important to make sure it fits properly. Learn more from the CDC about improving how your mask protects you.

863,What is an antigen test?,"An antigen test for COVID-19 is a type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.
Antigen tests are usually less sensitive than PCR tests, so they might miss some cases. Antigen tests could be more useful in certain circumstances:

For people who have symptoms of COVID-19. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.
Health care providers may use antigen testing when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctorâs office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that donât have a lot of PCR tests available.
Antigen tests may be used to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.
For surveillance purposes, to see what COVID-19 activity might be occurring in a community.

When used to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.
Antigen tests are different from antibody (serologic) tests, which identify people who have previously been infected with the COVID-19 virus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.

When can I return to work, school or child care?","If you develop new illness symptoms within the first 3 months of recovering from a COVID-19 infection, we do not recommend retesting. Data to date show that a person who has had and recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to 3 months after diagnosis. This means that if the person who has recovered from COVID-19 is retested within 3 months of their initial infection, they may continue to have a positive test result, even though they are not spreading COVID-19.
You should still stay home when you are sick to prevent spreading illness to others. You should remain home until your symptoms have improved or are gone. If you have a fever, you should stay home until you are fever-free (without the use of fever-reducing medicine) for at least 24 hours.

Many of Vermontâs border towns are economically and culturally linked to a neighboring stateâs border towns. Vermontâs cross state travel guidance allows people to travel between border towns for certain purposes without quarantining. This means that if you are a Vermonter living in a border town or if you live in a border town in a neighboring state, you do not need to quarantine only if:

You travel 5 miles into a neighboring state or into Vermont.
You travel to a neighboring state or to Vermont and back home in the same day.
You travel for an essential purpose or for an activity that is necessary for your physical or mental health. This includes going to worship, going to a gym, getting a haircut, and participating in place-based outdoor recreation. This does not include activities such as social gatherings, dining at a restaurant or bar, or going to an indoor entertainment venue (for example, a movie theater or bowling alley).

You must continue to follow the COVID-19 prevention measures, including wearing a mask and staying at least 6 feet away from people you donât live with, when you are in a border town in Vermont or in a neighboring state.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
868,How long does protection from the vaccine last?,"According to the CDC, we donât know how long protection lasts for those who are vaccinated. What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get very sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice.
Experts are working to learn more about both natural immunity and immunity from being vaccinated. The CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
869,How long does it take for the vaccine to protect me from getting COVID-19?,"You may not be protected from COVID-19 until you are fully vaccinated, which is 14 days after your final shot. It takes time for the vaccine to train your body to fight COVID-19.
The vaccine protects you from serious illness, but we donât know for sure if you can give the virus to someone else. Some recent studies suggest that a person who is vaccinated is less likely to infect other people with the COVID-19 virus. Until enough people are vaccinated and we know more, it is important to continue following the prevention steps, like wearing a mask, keeping 6 feet apart, and washing your hands, and to follow the social gathering guidelines, even after youâve been vaccinated.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
870,Can I still infect someone with the COVID-19 virus after I've been fully vaccinated?,"You may not be protected from COVID-19 until you are fully vaccinated, which is 14 days after your final shot. While the vaccine protects you from serious illness, we donât know yet if you can give the virus to someone else.
However, some recent studies suggest that a person who is vaccinated is less likely to infect other people with the COVID-19 virus. Until more research is done, it is important that you continue to follow the prevention steps, like wearing a mask, keeping 6 feet apart, and washing your hands, and to follow the social gathering guidelines, even after youâve been vaccinated.

871,How much does the COVID-19 vaccine cost?,"COVID-19 vaccines are free. COVID-19 vaccines are provided to Vermonters at no cost, even if you donât have health insurance.
You are guaranteed a COVID-19 vaccine without paying a fee. The provider that gives you your vaccine may charge an administrative fee to your insurance. If you donât have insurance, there is a federal grant that will pay for any administrative fees.
When you make an appointment to be vaccinated, you will be asked to provide your health insurance information. Insurance is not required, and someone who doesnât have insurance will still be able to get a vaccine. But being able to bill someoneâs primary insurance does help offset some of the costs.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
872,I am not able to leave my home. How can I get the vaccine?,"Homebound means you are not able to leave your home for scheduled medical or non-medical appointments. If you are currently eligible to get the vaccine and are homebound, you will be able to get the vaccine in your home.
If you are in the service of a local home health agency, the agency will reach out to you to schedule an appointment.
If you are not in the service of a home health agency, you may request an appointment by calling 802-863-7240 (toll-free 833-722-0860) Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Please do not make a request if you have already made one through your primary care provider, hospital, or home health agency. There is enough vaccine for everyone who is homebound. However, it will take time to reach everyone in need. In most cases, your appointment will be scheduled 10 to 14 days after you make a request.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
873,What can I do after I am fully vaccinated?,"You are fully vaccinated 14 days after your final shot. Until you are fully vaccinated, you should follow the same guidance as unvaccinated people. Learn about why it is important to get two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine.
Continue Prevention
Continue takingÂ steps to prevent COVID-19, except as described below.
The vaccine protects you from illness, but we donât know for sure if you can give the virus to someone else. Some recent studies suggest that a person who is vaccinated is less likely to infect other people with the COVID-19 virus. Until enough people are vaccinated and we know more, it is important to continue to follow prevention steps and continue to wear a mask, keep 6 feet apart, and wash your hands.
Gathering with Others
The following guidance only applies in non-health care settings.

You may gather with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks or staying 6 feet apart.
You may also gather with unvaccinated people from one household indoors without wearing masks or staying 6 feet apart, as long as everyone in that household is at low risk for severe COVID-19.

If you gather with people from more than one unvaccinated household, or with someone who is at higher risk of severe COVID-19, you must wear a mask and keep a 6-foot distance. SeeÂ details on gathering restrictions in Vermont.
Travel
You may travel to or return to Vermont without quarantine. Find outÂ more about travel, includingÂ staying in someone's home.
Close Contact of Someone with COVID-19
If you are a close contact of someone with COVID-19, as long as you do not have symptoms and are not in a health care setting:

You do not need to seek testing.
You do not need to quarantine.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
874,I am fully vaccinated. Do I need to quarantine if I am a close contact of someone with COVID-19?,"No. You do not need to quarantine if it has been 14 days since you got your final vaccine dose, and then you are exposed to someone with COVID-19 (for example, you are a close contact of someone with COVID-19),Â and you have not had any COVID-19 symptoms since the new exposure.
However, vaccinated inpatients and residents in health care settings will still need to quarantine if they are a close contact of someone with COVID-19. Read the CDCâs guidance.
This guidance does not apply to health care workers in certain situations.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
875,How many people are being monitored in Vermont?,"You can find information about Vermontâs COVID-19 vaccination progress on the COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard, including the number of doses received, total people started, total people completed, percentage of overall progress and percentage completed. The dashboard is updated Tuesdays through Saturdays.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
876,Can people who recover from COVID-19 be infected again?,"People who haveÂ recoveredÂ from COVID-19 can be infected again. Current data show that a person who had COVID-19 and recovered from it may have small amounts of the virusâs genetic materials in their body for at least three months after they were diagnosed with COVID-19. This means that if you have recovered from COVID-19 and are tested within three months of your initial infection, you may continue to have a positive test result.
The likelihood of a person being reinfected with COVID-19 within three months of their initial infection is low. Research regarding this is ongoing. Therefore, if you have recovered from COVID-19 and have new symptoms of COVID-19, you may need to be evaluated to see if you have COVID-19 again, especially if you are a close contact of someone with COVID-19. In this case, you should isolate and contact your health care provider to be evaluated for other causes of your symptoms, and possibly retested.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
877,What are the current restrictions on gatherings?,"Vermont has restrictions on social gatherings based on whether you are fully vaccinated or not. You are fully vaccinated 14 days after your final shot. Since children cannot get vaccinated at this time, a household with children is not considered a fully vaccinated household.
If you are fully vaccinated:

You may gather with other fully vaccinated people or households. You donât need to wear a mask or stay 6 feet apart when you gather.
You may gather with up to two unvaccinated people or households at a time. The gathering can also include other vaccinated people or households. If you gather with people from more than one unvaccinated household, or with someone who is at higher risk of severe COVID-19 or lives with someone at higher risk, everyone should wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart.

If you are not fully vaccinated:

You may gather with fully vaccinated people or households. You donât need to wear a mask or stay 6 feet apart, unless someone is at higher risk of severe COVID-19 or lives with someone at higher risk.
You may gather with one other unvaccinated person or household at a time. Fully vaccinated people or households can also be at the gathering. Everyone should wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart.
You can do outdoor recreation and fitness activities with anyone. This includes biking, hiking, walking, running, hunting and fishing, skiing, snowboarding, skating, snow machining and other no-contact outdoor activities. However, you must stay at least 6 feet away from people you donât live with and wear a mask at all times. Do not gather at trailheads, access areas or other outdoor facilities before or after the activity.
If you live alone, you may gather with people who live in one other household.
You can take in and shelter people from another household who are living in a dangerous, unhealthy or otherwise unsafe situation.

If you are a visitor traveling to Vermont and staying at a lodging establishment, short-term rental, or with friends and family, must follow these gathering restrictions. Staying with another household is considered a social gathering and you must follow the rules listed above. Learn more about Vermonters hosting visitors in their homes.
It is not considered a social gathering if you have contact with someone for less than 15 minutes, you both are wearing masks, and you stay at least 6 feet apart (for example, checking on a neighbor, friend or family member not in your household). You are allowed to come in contact with members of other households in settings that continue to operate â such as schools, workplaces, retail stores, close contact businesses, etc. â as long as all the required health protocols are followed.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
878,What is known about variants of the COVID-19 virus?,"Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur over time. Information about these variants is rapidly emerging. Scientists are working to learn more about how easily they spread, whether they could cause more severe illness, and whether currently authorized vaccines will protect people against them.
Multiple COVID-19 variants are circulating globally, namely in the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa and Brazil. According to the CDC, these variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than other variants, which may lead to more cases of COVID-19. You can find a map showing the number of confirmed cases caused by variants in the U.S.
The Health Department is working to detect any potential variants of concern â through genetic sequencing of certain specimens taken from various parts of the state and through wastewater testing in Burlington. We will continue this work, to help Vermonters understand any changes in the virus that may require us to strengthen our prevention efforts.
Here is what you can do to protect yourself and your community:

Keep up with prevention steps, like wearing masks, staying 6 feet apart, staying home if you are sick, washing your hands often, and avoiding crowded places. Prevention steps continue to be effective against variants.
Get tested if you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 or if you think you have any symptoms, even if they are mild. While a test is not able to determine if a variant is present, knowing that you have COVID-19 as soon as possible will help protect yourself and your community.
Get vaccinated when you are eligible. So far, studies suggest that the vaccines available now will help our bodies fight against strains of the virus that causes COVID-19.

Variants in Vermont

The B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, has now been detected in many U.S. states, including Vermont. The CDC anticipates the more easily transmissible B.1.1.7 variant will become the dominant strain in the country.
The B.1.429 variant, first identified in California, has been detected in Vermont.

If you are scheduling an appointment for a family member, we recommend that you create an account, and then sign them up as a âdependent.â You can watch a video on how to make an appointment online and find tips for making an appointment. Here are the steps you will need to take:
1. Create an account.
First, you will need to create an account in our online system. You will need an email address to create an account, and can use the same address for more than one person. Learn more about what to do if you donât have an email address.
If you already have an account because you were tested for COVID-19 through a Health Department site, you need to use the same account information to schedule an appointment to get a vaccine. The system will not allow you to create a new account if you use an email address that is already in the system.
If you already have an account, start at the âadd a dependentâ step below.
Here is how you create an account:

Go to the COVID-19 Event Portal.
Enter your name, phone number, email address, and date of birth.
Click the âcreate accountâ button.

After you create an account, an email is immediately sent to the email address you entered. You will need to verify your account on the COVID-19 Event Portal to make the personâs appointment:

Email address (use your email, the same one used to set up your account)
Phone number
Select how you would like to receive communication and documents from the Health Department.
Date of birth
Address
Enter their vaccine eligibility information, including their pass code (if applicable).

If the person getting the vaccine does not live in Vermont, the system will ask do they work in Vermont, get primary care in Vermont, or recently moved to Vermont. If none of these apply, they wonât be able to get vaccinated in Vermont, and should seek a vaccine in the state where they live.
3. Schedule a vaccine appointment.
Click the âSchedule Vaccine Appointmentâ button at the top of the screen and select their name. Select a clinic site location by searching by county and date range.
Next, you will answer a series of medical (see below) and demographic questions as well as questions about any COVID-19 symptoms the person has. You will be asked to provide their health insurance information. Insurance is not required, and there is no cost for getting the vaccine. You also will be asked to complete a waiver.
Finally, choose an appointment slot from the list of available appointments. Click the âsubmitâ button. You may be redirected to choose a different location and time depending on your vaccine eligibility. Once you make an appointment, you will immediately receive an email confirmation.
These are the medical screening questions asked:

Have you had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components? If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a vaccine. They should consider contacting their health care provider if they have questions.
Have you had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy? If the answer is yes, then they will be asked to contact their health care provider for a referral to an allergy/immunology specialist who can determine if they can safely receive the vaccine.
Are you currently sick with COVID-19 or still in your isolation period following a COVID-19 infection? If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a COVID-19 vaccine at this time, but can schedule an appointment at a later date.
Have you had a vaccine in the past 14 days or is a vaccination scheduled in the next 8 weeks? If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a COVID-19 vaccine at this time, but can schedule an appointment at a later date.
Have you received passive antibody therapy as treatment for COVID-19 in the past 90 days? If the answer is yes, then they will need to wait for 90 days before scheduling an appointment.
Do you have a weakened immune system caused by something such as HIV infection or cancer or do you take immunosuppressive drugs or therapies? If the answer is yes, they can make an appointment, but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.
Are you pregnant? If the answer is yes, they can make an appointment, but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.
Are you lactating or breastfeeding? If the answer is yes, they can make an appointment, but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ

If you are around other people, itâs safest to be outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of spreading or getting COVID-19.
For outdoor recreation with people you donât live with, keep a physical distance of at least 6 feet and wear a mask. There are no other limitations to outdoor activities. Being active outside is good for our mental and physical health!
If you are a fully vaccinated parent or caregiver and are traveling with children, your children will need to quarantine when they return to Vermont. This is because children cannot get vaccinated yet. Learn more about traveling and quarantine.
Follow these general prevention steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:

Stay home if you are sick.
Wash your hands often.
Keep your social circle small.
Stay at least 6 feet apart.
Wear a mask (children over 2 who are able).

There will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:

6-Foot Spaces: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?
Masks on Faces: Will people wear masks?
Uncrowded Places: Is there enough space for people to spread out?

Imagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more tips on preventing COVID-19.
Children can also continue to take advantage of technology to play games or keep in touch with friends and family. These changes will continue to be difficult, but we are all doing our part to slow down this pandemic.

885,I am pregnant or breastfeeding. Should I get vaccinated?,"Pregnant people are at an increased risk for severe illness and for poor pregnancy outcomes if they get COVID-19. Any of the vaccines can be given to people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
The three vaccines have not been studied in pregnant people. But medical and scientific experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk to the pregnant person or fetus because the vaccines cannot copy themselves in the body or cause infection. TheÂ American College of Obstetrics and GynecologyÂ recommendsÂ that COVID-19 vaccines should not be withheld from people who are pregnant, want to become pregnant, or who are lactating.
There are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in people who are breastfeeding or the effects of the vaccines on milk production/excretion or on the breastfed baby. Since these vaccines do not reproduce inside your bodyâs cells, they are not thought to be a risk to the breastfed baby.
The CDC and other professional organizations recommend that you talk with your health care provider if you have any questions about the vaccines.

The Health Department has a program that gives people who have tested positive for COVID-19 a free pulse oximeter to use at home. A pulse oximeter is a small device that clips onto your fingertip to measure your pulse and the oxygen levels in your body.
If you have tested positive for COVID-19, a Health Department staff member will contact you within 48 hours of receiving your lab result. They will ask questions about your symptoms and if you have a pulse oximeter at home. If you do not have one, you will receive one within one to two days, generally. You will then be asked to use it to monitor your oxygen levels throughout the day. The Health Department will continue to regularly contact you over the next several days to ask what your oxygen levels were and about any symptoms you may have.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
894,Are children more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus? How can I help my children from getting sick?,"According to the CDC, while fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults, children can be infected with the COVID-19 virus, can get sick from COVID-19, and can spread the virus to others. Children, like adults, who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others.
Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. However, some children can get severely ill from COVID-19. They might require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe. In rare cases, they might die. Babies under 1 year old and children with certain underlying conditions may be more likely to have severe illness from COVID-19. Learn more from the CDC about COVID-19 in children and teens.
A few children have developed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Currently, information about MIS-C is limited, and the CDC is working to learn more.
You can teach your children the prevention steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:

Stay home if you are sick.
Wash your hands often.
Keep your social circle small.
Stay at least 6 feet apart.
Wear a mask (children over 2 who are able).
Get the COVID-19 vaccine (when it becomes available to children).

Socializing for children is important for their development and wellbeing. There are ways children can socialize but still stay safe from getting or spreading COVID-19.
Find more resources for families with children and information from the CDC for children, teens and young adults.
You can find information about cases across age groups along with other COVID-19 data on the Vermont Dashboard.

896,Why was the Johnson & Johnson vaccine paused?,"Vermont has resumed use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as of April 26. The FDA and CDC announced that they studied and confirmed that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is recommended for people 18 years of age and older, and that the pause on its use since April 13 can be lifted.
The CDC announced the pause after reports of a small number of people developing a rare and severe type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). This type of blood clot is found in the blood vessels that drain blood from the brain and is combined with low platelets.
There have been no reported cases of these side effects in Vermont.
The pause was necessary to give the CDCâs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices time to review additional data about the reported side effects.
Vermontâs health care providers have been given information and guidance about the potential blood clotting symptoms and appropriate medical treatment. They will be given any updated guidance.
Although the side effects of concern are extremely rare, the FDA and CDC recommend that you should contact your health care provider right away if you develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks of receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest federally qualified health center or one of Vermontâs free & referral clinics.
To register for an appointment or to change the one you already have, go online or call 855-722-7878. Certain participating pharmacy partners, including CVS and Walgreens, are making plans to also offer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. You can contact those pharmacies directly to make an appointment or to reschedule.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
897,Do I have to be a Vermont resident to get the COVID-19 vaccine?,"Yes. You will need to provide your address to make an appointment for the COVID-19 vaccine. However, if you live in another state, you can still get a vaccine in Vermont if:

You work in one of these occupations or settings in Vermont: health care personnel, child care worker, work in a school, or work in the public safety system.
You moved to Vermont within the last 6 months with the intention of becoming a resident.
You attend a college, university or other educational institution in Vermont (including boarding school).
You live in Vermont for part of the year.

If you are a resident of another state and have a primary care provider in Vermont, you are not eligible to get a vaccine in Vermont. This is because primary care providers do not have vaccine to give right now. You will need to get the vaccine in your home state.

898,Is it possible to get COVID-19 even if Iâm fully vaccinated?,"Yes. COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious disease, including hospitalization and death. But no vaccine is 100% effective. That means some people who are vaccinated may become infected with COVID-19. This is called a âvaccine breakthrough.â This happens with any vaccine including measles, mumps, flu and others.
As more people are vaccinated, it is likely that the number of people who get sick with COVID-19 even after getting vaccinated will increase, especially if the amount of COVID-19 virus in our communities remains high. This growing number may sound concerning, but this is expected. Fortunately, the percentage of people who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated should stay low. Among those who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated, few will get very sick.
Community Immunity
Vaccine protection is more than one person being vaccinated. The more virus going around in the community, the higher your chances of coming into close contact with someone who is sick with COVID-19. When enough people in a community are protected against a contagious disease, it's very hard for it to spread. It is this community immunity that helps protect us all from getting sick. This is why â until we reach community immunity and the amount of virus in our community goes down â our prevention steps are so important.
Variants
Scientific studies show that some vaccines may not work as well on some of the variants. Studies with people in real world conditions are ongoing. Variants are circulating in Vermont and the numbers of people getting sick with COVID-19 is rising. Vermontâs numbers are too small to make any conclusions about the role of variants and the infections among fully vaccinated people that we are seeing. The Health Department is working to increase our ability to sequence more samples and select certain samples, like those among fully vaccinated people to look at more closely.

900,Do I have a choice of which vaccine I get? Which vaccine should I get?,"If you are making an appointment through the Health Department system, you will see the name of the vaccine listed after the âeventâ description. However, there is no way to search for an appointment based on which vaccine is available. Currently, most clinics are offering the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines (two-dose), and some are offering the Johnson & Johnson (single dose) vaccine. Learn about why the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was briefly paused.
Please note that only sites with the Pfizer vaccine will show up for people age 16 and 17 since that is the only vaccine that has been authorized for people age 16 and older. You may need to look at neighboring counties if nothing comes up in your county.
For the two-dose vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), you should get the same vaccine for both your first and second dose. You will also be given a card with the name of the vaccine you received when you get your first shot. If you have a smartphone, you may want to take a picture of the card in case you misplace it.
Find out how to make your second dose appointment.
All three vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson) are safe and similarly effective at preventing severe illness and death. This standard is what is most commonly used to assess other vaccines like the flu shot. We cannot directly compare the effectiveness of the three vaccines because they were not studied against each other at the same time. Each clinical trial had different study protocols, timing and location. For example, variants werenât widely circulating when the earlier vaccines were being tested.
The vaccines available have similar side effects. Side effects are a normal way that your body builds immunity to COVID-19.

901,Why canât children and adolescents get the COVID-19 vaccine?,"Childrenâs immune systems are different at different ages. They are also different from adults.
In early April, Pfizer-BioNTech asked the FDA to expand use of its COVID-19 vaccine to adolescents ages 12 to 15. If approved, we may be able to start vaccinating this age group in May or June. We will provide more details when we have them.
Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are each running clinical vaccine trials with adolescents aged 12 to 17. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have clinical trials of their vaccines for younger children going on now.
If the trials are successful, there will be the usual review processes before the vaccines can be approved for emergency use and then produced for distribution. This process can take a while, especially for very young ages, which are usually tested last.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for people 16 years and older.
The Moderna vaccine is authorized for people 18 years and older.
The Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine is authorized for people 18 years and older.

Because children under 16 cannot get vaccinated at this time, they will need to get tested when they travel and are not considered part of a fully vaccinated household. Learn more about traveling out of state and gathering restrictions.

The length of the entire process will vary, but you can expect it to take about 2 months from when you sign up to when you are considered fully vaccinated. This includes the time between when you make your appointment, the time of getting your first and final dose, and the 14 days after your final dose for the vaccine to be most effective.",https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/faqs,en,Vermont | Covid-19 FAQ
903,How do I protect my vaccine card? Can I get a new one if I lose it?,"Once you get your vaccine card, put it in a safe place so you donât lose it. You can keep it in your wallet or store it with other important documents. You can also take a picture of it with your smartphone, if you have one. You may need to show your card when you travel, so be sure to carry it with you and be prepared to show it when asked.
If your vaccine requires a second dose, you should have scheduled your second dose at the clinic where you received your first dose. We recommend bringing your vaccine card to your second dose appointment, but it is not required.
You may want to protect your card. If you choose to get your vaccine card laminated, please note that the ink used to write in your dose could run when heat is applied. Also, if booster shots are needed, they wonât be able to be recorded if the card is laminated.
If you lost your vaccine card, the Vermont Immunization Registry has your vaccination record. You can request a record of your vaccine from the Immunization Registry directly or through your health care provider.

Children in shared custody that are in isolation because they have tested positive for COVD-19, or are in quarantine because they were identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, may isolate or quarantine in either household. It does not affect the shared custody schedule. However, this means that members of the household where the child is staying may need to quarantine. If the child is in isolation, household members will be required to quarantine.

CDC recommends delaying travel until you are fully vaccinated, because travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19.
Unvaccinated people (including children) must have a COVID-19 test within 3 days before arriving in Vermont.

924,Can I get COVID-19 from swimming in a lake or river?,"There is no evidence that the virus can spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs or water playgrounds. Proper operation and disinfection of the water (for example, with chlorine and bromine) should kill the virus.
There is also no evidence that the COVID-19 virus spreads to people through the water in lakes, oceans, rivers or other natural bodies of water.
The virus has been found in untreated wastewater, which means it could possibly enter lakes or rivers when untreated wastewater is discharged into waterways after rainstorms or for other reasons. According to the CDC, it is currently thought that the risk of getting COVID-19 from properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is low because the wastewater treatment process removes and degrades many viruses and bacteria. There has been no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because they came in contact with wastewater.
The Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly E. coli testing and after large rainstorms during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the E. coli levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.
The best practices for staying healthy while swimming are to obey signage at beaches, do not swim during and following large rainstorms, and do not swallow the water.

Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are given about 21 days apart.
Doses of the Moderna vaccine are given about 28 days apart.

For the vaccine to be the most effective and help prevent you from getting COVID-19, itâs best to get your second shot as close to the recommended schedule as possible. It is okay to get your shot 4 days before the recommended schedule. But if you miss your second dose, get it as soon as you can.

Once you get your vaccine card, put it in a safe place so you donât lose it. You can keep it in your wallet or store it with other important documents. You can also take a picture of it with your smartphone, if you have one. You may need to show your card when you travel, so be sure to carry it with you and be prepared to show it when asked.

You need to have an appointment to get a vaccine. However, from time to time, some clinics will be able to accept walk-ins. When that happens, we will share that information on our website and on social media.
To help make sure we do not waste vaccine doses, state-run clinics make an estimate of how many doses may remain at the end of the day. If there is a possibility that there will be extra doses, then clinic staff will estimate how many may be available and call people who are currently scheduled for a future COVID-19 vaccine appointment to come in. We canât guarantee that you will get the vaccine earlier if you are called because the estimated number of available doses could change.
The Health Department will reach out to you if there is a certain clinic that needs people for a standby list. Please do not call the Health Department to be put on the standby list. If you made an appointment through the state registration system that is three weeks or more away, you may get a call to ask if you are interested in being on the standby list.
