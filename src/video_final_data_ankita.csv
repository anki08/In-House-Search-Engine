https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCE3RPkMV8M,0,What is a novel coronavirus?,"0:06
So, the coronavirus are amongst us all the time. We have the so-called calm
0:13
coronavirus which results in respiratory infections with runny nose, and cough and
0:19
sore throat, mostly during winter time. There are some coronavirus strains like
0:26
the new novel coronavirus which has a more severe presentation of symptoms
0:33
similar to what we had in the past with SARS and more recently MERS-CoV virus.
0:39
This being said, it seems based on current data that the new or the novel
0:45
coronavirus is somewhere in the middle in terms of severity between our common
0:51
coronaviruses and SARS and MERS. So, from an HHS perspective, the main emphasis at
0:58
this point is on screening. We want to make sure that no patient gets into our
1:03
system without us knowing that the patient was potentially exposed to a
1:08
patient with the novel coronavirus or a patient with a relevant travel history.
1:13
This being said, this definition, of what we call the case definition, may change
1:20
any time and what I'm telling you right now may be different later today.
1:25
For most people it will not make a major difference when they get in to a
1:29
hospital, it being at Hamilton health sciences or any of the other hospitals.
1:33
The screening consists of questions you are being asked when you get registered
1:39
or when you're going through triage, and they will
1:45
ask you whether you have a relevant travel history and whether you have any
1:49
respiratory symptoms. This being said, this is not a new concept. We used to ask
1:58
those questions previously as well. But, now we do react if you would be telling
2:03
us, ""Oh I was in Wuhan and I have a cough at this point of time."" If that's
2:09
the case you would be isolated in a private room, people seeing you would be
2:16
wearing gowns and masks and gloves just to make sure that if you have that virus
2:20
that it wouldn't transmit. And then you would need to get tested and we would
2:26
have to wait for that result. But, as you see, that only applies to those patients
2:32
who had a exposure or potential exposure to the virus. For everyone else it's
2:37
status quo, nothing would change other than the fact that you would need to
2:42
respond to those questions upon admission.",What is the Novel Coronavirus?,"Infectious disease specialist, Dr. Dominik Mertz, explains the new Coronavirus and what this means for patients visiting our hospitals.

A new type of coronavirus has emerged from the city of Wuhan in China.
0:06
Within weeks it has spread to several countries and has killed multiple people.
0:15
Corona refers to the virus’s distinctive shape.
0:20
They are a large group, common among mammals and birds.
0:27
But in rare cases like this one, they can spread to humans - a process known as zoonosis.
0:37
This new virus is the seventh known human coronavirus
0:41
and it affects the respiratory system.
0:44
Some coronaviruses have mild symptoms,
0:47
however others are much more dangerous.
0:51
SARS and MERS are both coronaviruses.
0:58
The most urgent question is how does it spread?
1:01
It seems that the virus can be transmitted between humans,
1:04
but it’s still unclear whether this happens routinely.
1:09
Some early severe cases caused a lot of concern,
1:13
but this has receded slightly, as more mild cases turn up.
1:17
The new virus does not seem to be as deadly as SARS,
1:20
which killed around 11% of the people it infected.
1:27
Researchers think that the virus originated
1:30
in an unknown animal at a market in Wuhan.
1:33
Identifying that animal could help control the current outbreak
1:37
and gauge its threat going forward.
1:41
The virus’s genetic code could offer clues to its origins and spread.
1:46
Labs in China and Thailand have sequenced at least 19 strains from infected people,
1:50
and made them publicly available.
1:53
Analysis is ongoing.
1:57
There are no known drugs that can effectively treat coronavirus infections in humans,
2:02
and no vaccines are currently licensed.
2:05
But researchers are working on the problem.
2:08
One possible avenue is to block the receptor
2:11
the viruses use to infect humans.
2:14
With more cases being reported every day,
2:16
the race is on to contain the outbreak.
2:19
And scientists are at the heart of the effort.","What you need to know about the novel coronavirus

germs are everywhere
0:07
they live on surfaces like tables door
0:09
handles
0:10
light switches on your mobile phone on
0:13
jewelry
0:14
on your skin and even inside your body
0:18
many of them aren't harmful to us in
0:20
fact there are numerous types that work
0:22
in harmony with our body to keep us
0:24
healthy
0:25
of course some germs are harmful and can
0:28
make us ill
0:29
if they gain entry into the body such as
0:31
through a cut in the skin
0:33
breathed in through the lungs or if you
0:35
eat something without washing your hands
0:37
they can cause an infection germs can
0:40
spread very easily
0:42
and our hands are particularly good at
0:44
picking them up and spreading them
0:46
from and to things that we touch which
0:48
increases the risk of them spreading to
0:50
people
0:52
despite this many germs including
0:54
coronaviruses
0:56
are easily inactivated or removed by
0:58
simply washing your hands with soap and
1:00
water
1:01
or by applying an alcohol hand rub
1:05
disposable gloves can protect your hands
1:07
from dirt
1:08
and should be worn if you think you may
1:10
come into contact with bodily fluids or
1:12
feces
1:14
but if you touch an infected surface the
1:16
gloves themselves can become
1:18
contaminated
1:19
which means they can still spread germs
1:21
in exactly the same way that ungloved
1:23
hands do
1:25
for example let's say you touch an
1:27
infected tissue with gloves on
1:30
you carry on with your usual day and
1:32
without thinking about it you rub your
1:34
eye
1:34
then later on you hand a glass of water
1:37
to someone you're caring for
1:40
the germs from the tissue have
1:41
effectively been passed on to anything
1:44
you touch
1:45
which means that you and this gentleman
1:47
could become ill
1:49
this is why gloves must be put on
1:51
immediately before one task
1:54
taken off immediately after it's done
1:56
and thrown away
1:58
you still need to wash your hands after
2:00
removing the gloves too
2:01
as germs can pass from the gloves onto
2:04
your hands
2:04
as you take them off like many other
2:08
germs the coronavirus is mostly spread
2:10
by droplets
2:11
which are breathed out from the lungs
2:13
and can directly enter another person's
2:15
mouth
2:15
nose or eyes allowing it to enter the
2:18
body
2:20
as we've seen if the infected droplets
2:22
find their way onto surfaces
2:24
such as if an infected person blows
2:27
their nose
2:28
then touches a door handle the virus can
2:30
then survive
2:31
there meaning someone else could become
2:34
infected
2:34
if they touch it too this is why
2:38
it's so important to follow appropriate
2:41
procedures for cleaning surfaces
2:43
to wash your hands properly and often
2:45
particularly before and after contact
2:48
with people you're caring for
2:50
to follow current advice on ppe such as
2:53
when to wear eye protection disposable
2:55
aprons or gloves
2:57
and to wear a surgical mask appropriate

0:07
think do I really need to go out most
0:09
people if you catch coronavirus it'll be
0:12
mild but for some coronavirus could be
0:14
really serious these are mostly older

protect yourself and the NHS says you
0:26
should do these things even if you're
0:28
not likely to be seriously affected by

coronavirus you may pass it on to
0:32
someone who could be number one wash
0:35
your hands more the more you wash your
0:37
hands the less likely you are to spread
0:39
the virus to other people so if you've
0:40
been out in a public place on a bus or a
0:42
train wash your hands as soon as you can
0:45
afterwards and properly wash your hands
0:46
so that takes about 20 seconds to get
0:49
them really clean focusing on all parts
0:51
of your hand not just your palm backs of
0:54
hands around the nails in between the
0:56
fingers wrists and your thumb and use

soap and water and when you're done turn
1:01
the tap off using a tissue and put it in
1:03
the bin antibacterial gels do work but
1:07
soap and water is best number two avoid
1:10
touching your eyes nose and mouth

sneeze or cough catch them with

disposable tissues then binet and wash
1:32
your hands
1:33
disposable tissues are better than
1:35
handkerchief so that you carry around
1:36
with you all the time if you don't have
1:38
a tissue sneeze or cough into the crook
1:40
of your elbow that way the germs are
1:44
away from your hands and you're less

likely to pass them on unless you greet

","People should be washing their hands for 20 seconds to protect themselves from the virus known as Covid-19. That's according to Public Health England.

The UK government is still working to contain the outbreak but the prime minister has warned that it's ""highly likely"" the UK will see further infection.

The BBC's online health editor, Michelle Roberts, and BBC digital health reporter, Laura Foster, examine the advice the NHS is giving when it comes to protecting yourself from the virus.

It was New Years Eve, 2019 when health officials in China admitted they had a problem.
0:04
Health authorities have activated their most serious response level.
0:08
After an outbreak of a new type of viral pneumonia
0:11
in central China.
0:13
A rapidly growing number of people were developing a dry cough and fever, before getting pneumonia.
0:20
And for some, it turned fatal.
0:23
Doctors have named the disease COVID-19 or “coronavirus disease, 2019” indicating
0:28
that a type of virus is causing the illness.
0:32
When they’d tried to trace its origin, they found a likely source:
0:36
This food market in Wuhan.
0:38
Out of the first 41 patients, 27 had been here.
0:42
It wasn’t conclusive evidence, but Chinese officials quickly shut down the market.
0:46
They had seen this happen before at a place just like this.
0:50
Health officials are trying to get a grip on an alarming outbreak of SARS.
0:55
The virus originated in mainland China.
0:57
Then spread across the country.
0:58
The disease had been festering for months in southern China.
1:02
In 2002, a coronavirus had emerged at a very similar market, in southern China.
1:06
It eventually reached 29 countries and killed nearly 800 people.
1:11
Now, 18 years later, this coronavirus is in at least 71 countries and has already killed
1:16
over 3100 people.
1:19
So, what do these markets have to do with the coronavirus outbreak… and why is it
1:23
happening in China?
1:33
A lot of the viruses that make us sick, actually originate in animals.
1:38
Some of the viruses that cause the flu come from birds and pigs.
1:42
HIV/AIDS comes from chimpanzees.
1:43
The deadly Ebola virus likely originates in bats.
1:46
And in the case of the 2019 coronavirus, there is some evidence it went from a bat to a pangolin
1:53
before infecting a human.
1:54
While viruses are very good at jumping between species, it’s rare for a deadly one to make
1:59
this journey all the way to humans.
2:01
That’s because it would need all these hosts to encounter each other at some point.
2:05
That’s where the Wuhan market comes in.
2:07
It’s a wet-market.
2:10
A kind of place where live animals are slaughtered and sold for consumption.
2:22
Peter Li is a professor and expert on China’s animal trade.
2:41
That’s exactly how a virus can jump from one animal to another.
2:45
If that animal then comes in contact with or is consumed by a human, the virus could
2:49
potentially infect them.
2:51
And if the virus then spreads to other humans, it causes an outbreak.
2:55
Wet-markets are scattered all over the world, but the ones in China are particularly well
2:59
known because they offer a wide variety of animals, including wildlife.
3:03
This is a sample menu, reportedly from the market in Wuhan.
3:07
These animals are from all over the world and each one has the potential to carry its
3:10
own viruses to the market.
3:13
The reason all these animals are in the same market is because of a decision China’s
3:16
government made decades ago.
3:22
Back in the 1970s, China was falling apart.
3:25
Famine had killed more than 36 million people.
3:28
And the communist regime, which controlled all food production, was failing to feed its
3:32
more than 900 million people.
3:36
In 1978, on the verge of collapse, the regime gave up this control and allowed private farming.
3:42
While large companies increasingly dominated the production of popular foods like pork
3:46
and poultry, some smaller farmers turned to catching and raising wild animals as a way
3:50
to sustain themselves.
4:03
And since it started to feed and sustain people, the Chinese government backed it.
4:20
But then in 1988, the government made a decision that changed the shape of wildlife trade in
4:25
China.
4:26
They enacted the Wildlife Protection Law which designated the animals as “resources owned
4:31
by the state” and protected people engaged in the “utilization of wildlife resources”.
4:49
The law also “encouraged the domestication and breeding of wildlife.”
4:53
With that, an industry was born.
4:57
Small local farms turned into industrial-sized operations.
5:03
For example, this bear farm started with just three, and eventually grew to more than 1,000 bears.
5:08
Bigger populations meant greater chances that a sick animal could spread disease.
5:13
Farmers were also raising a wide variety of animals.
5:15
Which meant more viruses on the farms.
5:19
Nonetheless, these animals were funneled into the wet-markets for profit.
5:24
While this legal wildlife farming industry started booming, it simultaneously provided
5:28
cover for an illegal wildlife industry.
5:31
Endangered animals like tigers, rhinoceroses, and pangolins, were trafficked into China.
5:36
By the early 2000s, these markets were teeming with wild animals when the inevitable happened.
5:41
The latest on the deadly SARS virus, the worldwide death toll up again today.
5:45
China has reported more than 1,400 cases of infection nation-wide.
5:51
It is what health officials have feared all along.
5:54
In 2003, the SARS outbreak was traced to a wet-market here, in southern China.
6:00
Scientists found traces of the virus in farmed civet cats.
6:03
Chinese officials quickly shut down the markets and banned wildlife farming.
6:06
But a few months after the outbreak, the Chinese government declared 54 species of wildlife
6:12
animals, including civet cats, legal to farm again.
6:16
By 2004, the wildlife-farming industry was worth an estimated $100 billion yuan.
6:20
And it exerted significant influence over the Chinese government.
6:33
It's because of this influence that the Chinese government has allowed these markets to grow
6:37
over the years.
6:38
In 2016, for example, the government sanctioned the farming of some endangered species like
6:43
tigers, and pangolins.
6:45
By 2018, the wildlife industry had grown to 148 billion yuan and had developed clever
6:51
marketing tactics to keep the markets around.
7:09
Yet, these products became popular with an influential portion of China’s population:
7:25
It’s this minority that the Chinese government chose to favor over the safety of the rest
7:29
of its population.
7:38
Soon after the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government shut down thousands
7:42
of wet-markets and temporarily banned wildlife trade again.
7:46
Organizations around the world have been urging China to make the ban permanent.
7:52
Chinese social media, in particular, has been flooded with petitions to ban it for good this time.
7:57
In response, China is reportedly amending the Wildlife Protection Law that encouraged
8:02
wildlife farming decades ago.
8:04
But unless these actions lead to a permanent ban on wildlife farming, outbreaks like this
8:08
one are bound to happen again.
8:15
For a bunch more information about China’s wet-markets, viruses, and wildlife,
8:20
we have an episode on our Netflix show called The Next Pandemic, explained.
8:24
It talks about a coronavirus could spark the next pandemic and what the world’s experts are doing to stop it.
8:29
That’s on our Netflix show ‘Explained’. Check it out.","How wildlife trade is linked to coronavirus
","And why the disease first appeared in China.

NOTE: As our expert Peter Li points out in the video, “The majority of the people in China do not eat wildlife animals. Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful –a small minority.”  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.
As of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.

Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the ""coronavirus"" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.",,,

summarize the risk of in-flight
1:28
transmission as low
1:30
an october article on the jama patient
1:32
page points out that risk is often low
1:34
on flights due to the way the cabin air
1:36
is maintained
1:38
the air volume in a plane's cabin is
1:40
refreshed regularly
1:41
with air entering from overhead and
1:43
flowing downward to exited floor outlets
1:46
from there around half is vented outside
1:49
while the rest is sent through high
1:50
efficiency particulate air filters
1:53
like those used in hospitals once
1:55
filtered the air is mixed with fresh air
1:57
brought in from
1:58
outside and then pushed back into the
2:00
cabin so the air is pretty clean
2:01
compared to most settings
2:03
but that's not to say that we haven't
2:04
seen some data suggesting risk
2:06
a 2003 study examined three separate
2:09
flights known to have carried someone
2:11
infected with
2:12
sars another coronavirus on one
2:14
three-hour flight
2:15
they found 22 probable transmissions
2:17
with 34
2:18
of those who sat in the same row or
2:21
within three rows of the infected
2:23
individual reporting illness
2:24
although 56 percent of the individuals
2:26
who became infected
2:28
were not seated within that proximity
2:30
however their examination of the other
2:32
two flights found possible infection of
2:34
only one person on a 90-minute flight
2:36

2:38

2:51
ranged from 211 to 313 minutes
2:54

2:58
simulated infection risk based on the

behavioral and movement data

3:12

3:13
a sick crew member would infect an
3:15

3:18
the researchers also gathered air and
3:20
hard surface samples to test for 18
3:22
common respiratory viruses
3:24
all of which came back negative another
3:25
study out this month found that the
3:26
current coronavirus was transmitted to
3:28

3:31
on a 10-hour flight 12 of those were in
3:33
business class with the only symptomatic
3:36
person on the flight
3:37
while the other 25 were seated elsewhere
3:39
so the results are mixed
3:41
some of these studies considered the
3:42
behavior of those on board and some did
3:44
not
3:44
some considered mask usage and some did
3:47
not some studied flights with known
3:49
infections on board while others
3:50
employed simulations
3:52
and of course none of them can
3:53
definitively prove the occurrence of
3:55
in-flight transmission the cdc does
3:57
mention that air circulation in plane
3:59
cabins prevents easy spread of viruses
4:01
and other germs but notes that socially
4:04
distancing is difficult on crowded
4:05
flights
4:06
and thus the risk of contracting covid19
4:08
may be increased
4:09
that risk might be reduced by the use of
4:11
face masks which are currently mandatory
4:12
when flying
4:13
and by measures like leaving the middle
4:15
seat open which one pre-print suggests
4:17
might make a difference
4:18
however no one seems to be talking about
4:20
the risk outside of the airplane

0:02
Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 is an illness
0:05
caused by a virus.
0:08
Anyone can get COVID-19,
0:11
and may have symptoms of fever, chills,
0:16
cough, sore throat, runny nose,
0:23
shortness of breath,
0:27
or loss of taste or smell.
0:31
Most people have mild symptoms and recover,
0:34
but some people like older people
0:36
or people with medical conditions may get seriously ill,
0:40
and may even need to go to the hospital.
0:44
COVID-19 is very contagious.
0:47
It can spread when a person coughs or sneezes
0:50
the virus into the air.
0:53
People may breathe in the virus
0:54
or touch the virus on surfaces.
0:58
You can get sick from touching your face
1:00
if you have the virus on your hands.

For almost a decade, scientists chased the source of a deadly new virus
0:12
through China’s tallest mountains and most isolated caverns.
0:16
They finally found it here: in the bats of Shitou Cave.
0:21
The virus in question was a coronavirus
0:23
that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome,
0:27
or SARS, in 2003.
0:30
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses
0:32
covered in little protein spikes that look like a crown—
0:36
or ""corona"" in Latin.
0:38
There are hundreds of known coronaviruses.
0:41
Seven of them infect humans, and can cause disease.
0:45
The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, MERS-CoV causes MERS,
0:51
and SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19.
0:56
Of the seven human coronaviruses, four cause colds,
1:01
mild, highly contagious infections of the nose and throat.
1:05
Two infect the lungs, and cause much more severe illnesses.
1:10
The seventh, which causes COVID-19, has features of each:
1:14
it spreads easily, but can severely impact the lungs.
1:18
When an infected person coughs, droplets containing the virus spray out.
1:23
The virus can infect a new person when the droplets enter their nose or mouth.
1:28
Coronaviruses transmit best in enclosed spaces,
1:31
where people are close together.
1:33
Cold weather keeps their delicate casing from drying out,
1:36
enabling the virus to survive for longer between hosts,
1:40
while UV exposure from sunlight may damage it.
1:43
These seasonal variations matter more for established viruses.
1:47
But because no one is yet immune to a new virus,
1:50
it has so many potential hosts that it doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread.
1:55
In the body, the protein spikes embed in the host’s cells and fuse with them—
2:00
enabling the virus to hijack the host cell’s machinery
2:02
to replicate its own genes.
2:05
Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA.
2:08
All viruses are either RNA viruses or DNA viruses.
2:12
RNA viruses tend to be smaller, with fewer genes,
2:15
meaning they infect many hosts and replicate quickly in those hosts.
2:20
In general, RNA viruses don’t have a proofreading mechanism,
2:24
whereas DNA viruses do.
2:27
So when an RNA virus replicates,
2:29
it’s much more likely to have mistakes called mutations.
2:33
Many of these mutations are useless or even harmful.
2:37
But some make the virus better suited for certain environments—
2:40
like a new host species.
2:42
Epidemics often occur when a virus jumps from animals to humans.
2:47
This is true of the RNA viruses that caused
2:49
the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
2:55
Once in humans, the virus still mutates—
2:58
usually not enough to create a new virus,
3:00
but enough to create variations, or strains, of the original one.
3:05
Coronaviruses have a few key differences from most RNA viruses.
3:09
They’re some of the largest, meaning they have the most genes.
3:13
That creates more opportunity for harmful mutations.
3:16
To counteract this risk, coronaviruses have a unique feature:
3:21
an enzyme that checks for replication errors and corrects mistakes.
3:25
This makes coronaviruses much more stable,
3:27
with a slower mutation rate, than other RNA viruses.
3:31
While this may sound formidable,
3:33
the slow mutation rate is actually a promising sign
3:36
when it comes to disarming them.
3:38
After an infection, our immune systems can recognize germs
3:42
and destroy them more quickly if they infect us again
3:45
so they don’t make us sick.
3:47
But mutations can make a virus less recognizable to our immune systems—
3:51
and therefore more difficult to fight off.
3:53
They can also make antiviral drugs and vaccines less effective,
3:57
because they’re tailored very specifically to a virus.

For almost a decade, scientists chased the source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains and most isolated caverns. They finally found it in the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. So what exactly is a coronavirus, and how does it spread? Elizabeth Cox explain",,,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DsVhaXx8_I,6,Is it true that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats?,"0:04
it's very likely that this virus has
0:07
come from bats bats have lots of viruses
0:10
very few of these viruses actually make
0:12
them stick bets I'm not a villain
0:15
coronaviruses are a type of virus that
0:17
can spread from animals to humans and
0:19
cause diseases like SARS and MERS the
0:22
latest coronavirus outbreak started in
0:24
Wuhan China so far it's killed almost
0:27
1,400 people and infected more than
0:29
60,000 around the world scientists are
0:32
racing to figure out how humans
0:34
contracted the new virus based on
0:36
initial genetic testing and past
0:38
outbreaks they say it's likely the
0:40
corona virus originated in bats there
0:42
was a recent paper put out that they did
0:45
a sequence of a virus that they found
0:47
that the closest relative to the Wuhan
0:50
bark was a virus from that 96% similar I
0:54
think that is pretty accepted that the
0:57
viruses are very likely coming from
0:59
bouts but how they're getting to us from
1:01
bats either directly or through some
1:03
intermediate hosts needs to be worked
1:05
out though for this new one there isn't
1:07
one particular kind or species of bats
1:11
at the Loews theater was spill overs for
1:13
NEPA and Hendra it's the big fruit bats
1:16
for SARS and murd and this one it's
1:20
smaller insect eating bats other animals
1:23
have passed viruses between bats and
1:25
humans before SARS really spread from
1:27
civet cats into humans but now we know
1:30
that the virus some point in time jumped
1:32
from bats into civet cats but moose what
1:34
we think happened there is that a corona
1:37
virus jumped from bats into dromedary
1:39
camels and recently was seeing this
1:42
virus jumping from dromedary camels into
1:45
the human population now Chinese
1:47
scientists say penguins could be the
1:50
middlemen but their research hasn't been
1:52
made public yet
1:53
penguins are the most trafficked animal
1:56
in the world and they're basically like
1:58
an armadillo with plates so they've got
2:00
these really long scales and those
2:03
scales are prized in traditional Chinese
2:06
medicine
2:07
I think the isolation of this virus from
2:10
pangolins is going to cause a lot of
2:12
stir because work there is going to be
2:14
kind of a knee-jerk reaction to
2:16
like you know penguins are probably the
2:18
more that people look at some of the
2:21
genetic data that you'll get a little
2:22
bit of infighting in the scientific
2:24
community as to really whether or not
2:26
the penguin virus is the true direct
2:28
link or if it's just maybe another piece
2:31
of the puzzle I think we should be
2:32
really cautious until we see the paper
2:35
that comes out scientists don't need to
2:37
know where the virus came from in order
2:39
to develop a vaccine but identifying the
2:41
origin can help contain the current
2:43
outbreak and prevent future ones
2:45
the Sasse outbreak the government banned
2:48
the sale of food cats because we have
2:50
now determined that civet cats could do
2:52
more coronavirus exposures so something
2:55
similar could happen if with a hundred
2:57
percent confidence we can identify it
2:59
that was this animal early reports
3:01
linked the first coronavirus patients to
3:03
a market in Wuhan where bats might have
3:05
been sold as food new testing has raised
3:08
doubts about the markets role in the
3:09
outbreak but xenophobia toward eating
3:11
bats has still festered
3:13
if you cook meat you're going to destroy
3:15
viruses like coronaviruses because not
3:18
very eat stable but they're handling the
3:21
animals or handling the meat or
3:22
preparing the meat with certainly put
3:24
you addressing chickens give us a minute
3:26
all the time do we stop eating chickens
3:28
no just stigmatizing our traditional
3:31
practice or someone's food doesn't help
3:33
the cause it's wrong you got to
3:34
understand the science and explain it to
3:36
them scientists do know that bats and
3:38
rodents carry a relatively high number
3:40
of viruses but bats often don't get sick
3:43
from them if we can figure out why bats
3:45
don't get sick we may be able to apply
3:47
it to reducing the effects of viral in
3:50
fact if we don't have tarragon answers
3:53
we've got a lot of hypotheses one is
3:55
that bats are the only mammals that have
3:58
evolved the ability to fly flying takes
4:02
up an enormous bit of energy as a
4:05
byproduct of all that metabolic activity
4:08
you generate toxic molecules what bats
4:12
have done is involved to do with that
4:14
those properties for whatever reason
4:17
allow
4:18
to deal with viruses well but all this
4:21
is conjecture Union other groups are
4:24
what the units have identified molecular
4:25
mechanisms that bats have evolved that
4:27
suppresses inflammation in bats so bats
4:30
have a good antiviral response that
4:32
helps them control virus replication and
4:34
they have low levels of inflammation
4:36
despite the animals potential
4:38
relationship to the new corona virus
4:40
biologists don't want people to vilify
4:42
bats many of which are endangered the
4:45
reputation of bats is that is a very
4:47
high concern that's is so essential for
4:51
our ecosystems for example the bats that
4:53
I study the flying foxes a major
4:55
pollinators we love baths we use bats as
4:58
a model to understand the superior
5:00
immune responses they have as mammals if
5:02
we want to learn from them and hopefully
5:03
identify therapeutic targets for humans
5:06
the more we kind of blend humans and
5:08
animals the more we're going to see all
5:10
of these new viruses that humans have
5:12
never seen it's not like it's just bats
5:13
it's possible that a candle virus might
5:15
avoid some point in time in the future
5:17
if anything humans had a problem because
5:20
we are encroaching on that domains","Here’s How Scientists Think Coronavirus Spreads from Bats to Humans
","Bats carry tons of viruses. But scientists think one in particular has recently infected the human population and killed nearly 1,400 people: China’s new coronavirus.

Scientists don’t really know why, but bats usually don’t get sick from the viruses inside them. A recent genetic study, however, found that the coronavirus in bats and the one making humans sick are a 96% match.",,,

covid 19 continues to spread around the
0:02
globe
0:03
you can help stop covid19 by
0:05
participating in contact tracing
0:07
how does contact tracing work contact
0:10
tracing is a system that has been used
0:12
for decades to stop infectious diseases
0:14
a contact is anyone who has had direct
0:16
physical contact
0:17
or was within one meter for at least 15
0:19
minutes with an infected person
0:21
even if that person does not have
0:23
symptoms this applies to anyone who has
0:25
had contact from two days before a
0:27
person gets sick
0:28
until 14 days afterwards or from the 14
0:31
days when an asymptomatic case tested
0:33
positive
0:35
once you are confirmed as a contact you
0:37
will be asked to go into quarantine
0:39
which means to separate yourself from
0:41
others and to monitor your health for
0:42
any signs of illness
0:44
the monitoring ends on the 14th day from
0:46
your last contact with the person
0:48
infected with covid19
0:50
quarantine can take place in a special
0:52
facility outside of your home
0:53
or at home if you can stay separated
0:55
from family members
0:57
why 14 days of quarantine it can take
1:00
from 1 to 14 days from contact with the
1:02
virus to develop symptoms
1:04
during this time you should stay in
1:06
quarantine and monitor symptoms
1:07
and follow instructions given to you if
1:09
you become symptomatic
1:11
without contact tracing and quarantine
1:13
the virus will continue to spread
1:15
this leads to more people becoming sick
1:17
and infecting the most vulnerable
1:19
by identifying and limiting contacts of
1:21
people infected with covid19
1:23
the virus stops spreading and the
1:25
community stays safe
1:27
to break the chains of transmission we
1:29
all need to work together
1:31
if you become sick with covid19 stay
1:33
away from others
1:34
follow the recommendations of your
1:36
medical care provider and share the list
1:38
of people who you came in close contact
1:40
with
1:40
with your help we can prevent further
1:42
spread of the virus and save more
1:44
people's lives

1:47
chains of covid19 transmission

hi my name is Ruth I am a public health
0:05
nurse with horizon health network in the
0:07
Fredericton Public Health Office I work
0:10
with a wonderful team of nurses here and
0:13
collaborate closely with my communicable
0:15
disease nurse colleagues in Miramichi
0:18
and st. John as part of horizon and
0:22
collaborate often and on an ongoing
0:24
basis with my colleagues doing the same
0:26
work in vitality so during any outbreak
0:30
we begin when we have a confirmed case
0:33
and we manage the case and then we
0:38
enlarge that investigation to include
0:40
contacts and we have to often find the
0:43
contacts which is kind of part of what
0:47
contact tracing entails and then we
0:50
consider communications and control
0:52
measures immediate control measures and
0:54
control measures that would need to be
0:56
put in place so contact tracing is
0:59
basically talking to the case and asking
1:02
where have you been whom have you been
1:04
with who do you live with who do you
1:07
work with who do you play with as far as
1:10
recreation would go as far as what they
1:13
do outside of work in school and we
1:16
would look back with respect to Kovan 19
1:19
for two days prior to symptom onset I do
1:23
believe contact tracing is important and
1:26
cornerstone to preventing transmission
1:28
of illness particularly with Co Vadim
1:32
it's time-sensitive it's important that
1:35
we identify who contacts would be and
1:38
give contacts engage them and give them
1:43
opportunity to share in responsibility
1:46
to self isolate and to take measures to
1:48
protect their own health and protect the
1:50
health of loved ones around them it is
1:53
their opportunity to step aside and to
1:55
make sure this is not passed from them
1:57
to any other additional persons the hope
2:01
is that if that person is followed for
2:05
14 days at any point if they develop
2:07
symptoms that they have been self
2:09
isolating
2:10
and the only contacts that they would
2:13
have are the people that are in their
2:15
immediate household so that's the ideal
2:18
and it is a win-win for everyone if we
2:20
can prevent transmission

For almost a decade, scientists chased the source of a deadly new virus
0:12
through China’s tallest mountains and most isolated caverns.
0:16
They finally found it here: in the bats of Shitou Cave.
0:21
The virus in question was a coronavirus
0:23
that caused an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome,
0:27
or SARS, in 2003.
0:30
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses
0:32
covered in little protein spikes that look like a crown—
0:36
or ""corona"" in Latin.
0:38
There are hundreds of known coronaviruses.
0:41
Seven of them infect humans, and can cause disease.
0:45
The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, MERS-CoV causes MERS,
0:51
and SARS-CoV-2 causes the disease COVID-19.
0:56
Of the seven human coronaviruses, four cause colds,
1:01
mild, highly contagious infections of the nose and throat.
1:05
Two infect the lungs, and cause much more severe illnesses.
1:10
The seventh, which causes COVID-19, has features of each:
1:14
it spreads easily, but can severely impact the lungs.
1:18
When an infected person coughs, droplets containing the virus spray out.
1:23
The virus can infect a new person when the droplets enter their nose or mouth.
1:28
Coronaviruses transmit best in enclosed spaces,
1:31
where people are close together.
1:33
Cold weather keeps their delicate casing from drying out,
1:36
enabling the virus to survive for longer between hosts,
1:40
while UV exposure from sunlight may damage it.
1:43
These seasonal variations matter more for established viruses.
1:47
But because no one is yet immune to a new virus,
1:50
it has so many potential hosts that it doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread.
1:55
In the body, the protein spikes embed in the host’s cells and fuse with them—
2:00
enabling the virus to hijack the host cell’s machinery
2:02
to replicate its own genes.
2:05
Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA.
2:08
All viruses are either RNA viruses or DNA viruses.
2:12
RNA viruses tend to be smaller, with fewer genes,
2:15
meaning they infect many hosts and replicate quickly in those hosts.
2:20
In general, RNA viruses don’t have a proofreading mechanism,
2:24
whereas DNA viruses do.
2:27
So when an RNA virus replicates,
2:29
it’s much more likely to have mistakes called mutations.
2:33
Many of these mutations are useless or even harmful.
2:37
But some make the virus better suited for certain environments—
2:40
like a new host species.
2:42
Epidemics often occur when a virus jumps from animals to humans.
2:47
This is true of the RNA viruses that caused
2:49
the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
2:55
Once in humans, the virus still mutates—
2:58
usually not enough to create a new virus,
3:00
but enough to create variations, or strains, of the original one.
3:05
Coronaviruses have a few key differences from most RNA viruses.
3:09
They’re some of the largest, meaning they have the most genes.
3:13
That creates more opportunity for harmful mutations.
3:16
To counteract this risk, coronaviruses have a unique feature:
3:21
an enzyme that checks for replication errors and corrects mistakes.
3:25
This makes coronaviruses much more stable,
3:27
with a slower mutation rate, than other RNA viruses.
3:31
While this may sound formidable,
3:33
the slow mutation rate is actually a promising sign
3:36
when it comes to disarming them.
3:38
After an infection, our immune systems can recognize germs
3:42
and destroy them more quickly if they infect us again
3:45
so they don’t make us sick.
3:47
But mutations can make a virus less recognizable to our immune systems—
3:51
and therefore more difficult to fight off.
3:53
They can also make antiviral drugs and vaccines less effective,
3:57
because they’re tailored very specifically to a virus.
4:01
That’s why we need a new flu vaccine every year—
4:04
the influenza virus mutates so quickly that new strains pop up constantly.
4:09
The slower mutation rate of coronaviruses means
4:11
our immune systems, drugs, and vaccines
4:14
might be able to recognize them for longer after infection,
4:18
and therefore protect us better.
4:21
Still, we don’t know how long our bodies remain immune to different coronaviruses.

Minus the wait.
0:13
Hi, so we have a patient with a positive screening named Christine.
0:16
[Reporter] The screener share symptoms in travel history with a nurse
0:20
who prepares to take a look.
0:22
Now the person that's being screened is supposed to sit about two meters

I'm one of the nurses here.
0:32
You can please follow me.
0:34
[Reporter] More questions followed by a quick exam.
0:37
The information then gets passed on to the doctor.
0:41
[Nurse] Then she or he will decide whether to do a swab or not to test COVID-19.
0:45
[Reporter] After a quick check, the ER doctor makes the call.
0:49
A nasal swab goes down the throat or up through the nose.

0:55
Okay, I've never had this done before.

[Reporter] Yes, it's startling but it's over in a moment.
1:01
[Nurse] That's it.
1:03
It's all done.
1:04
[Reporter]The results take 24 hours but doctors urge people not to just show up in hospital.
1:09
[Dr. Erin O'Connor] We need to be very careful about is not over burdening the department
1:13
so that we can still look after the very sick people.
1:17
[Reporter] Staff are also preparing for those scenarios.
1:20
[Dr. Erin O'Connor] We also have been really running drills on the worst case scenario

okay hi it's dr. Stan Jacobs again and
0:03
the no surgeon that gave a little video
0:05
the other day about how to do a proper
0:08
nasal pharyngeal swab for kovat and one
0:12
of the things that we we got some good
0:14
responses about the anatomy and
0:16
everything but what I forgot to tell you
0:17
or what I didn't do was an actual swab
0:20
so daniyar nurses said that you do that
0:25
today when you do it before the first
0:27
the bit question you want to ask the
0:28
patient is which side are you breathing
0:31
out well right now the left side so
0:34
she's saying the left side screens
0:35
better cuz obviously then the turbot it
0:37
may be small on that side cuz the
0:38
turbinates swell and shrink which of the
0:40
structures inside you know is in here or
0:42
on the sides you can see them there and
0:44
there and they will vary from side to
0:47
side that's why sometimes you say oh I
0:48
can breathe through this side versus the
0:49
other side that's not a deviated septum
0:51
that's just the nasal cycle which varies
0:54
in terms of swelling with colds or flu
0:57
or anything so we're going to go on the
0:59
left side so again we want to be
1:01
horizontal with the nose I'm gonna
1:03
actually tilt her up only a bit because
1:05
I'm high taller than she is and then I'm
1:07
going to just gently go in there I want
1:09
to stay along the floor it is going to
1:15
be uncomfortable so breathe
1:24
there okay so I that was party except
1:28
them and very slowly now because it's
1:30
less I'm careful if you go slower and
1:34
now I'm at the back and that's when she
1:36
made that weird face and I think you can
1:39
do whirl it around back there and then
1:40
out and that's it good say she do

Hi my name is Emma McAdam and I'm a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist.
0:03
As a therapist I've increasingly seen how many people out there either
0:08
experience mental illness on their own or they love and care about someone who
0:12
does experience mental illness and I've also come to see how difficult it is for
0:17
many people to access the resources they need to improve their mental health
0:23
I created Therapy in a Nutshell because my mission is to create mental health
0:27
resources that are easy to access so that people know how to help themselves
0:32
and others with mental illness. On this channel I'm gonna be putting up lots of
0:37
exercises, techniques, skills, and resources that you can easily
0:41
use to combat anxiety depression and other concerns so I hope you find this

larson welcome back it is always a joy
0:02
to have you here
0:04
um i was hoping that you could share
0:06
with us a couple of things and maybe
0:07
starting with
0:08
um the mental health library that you've
0:10
been putting together to help
0:12
families patients and and kiddos to
0:14
thrive yeah absolutely
0:16
so mental health books are something
0:17
that i'm really passionate about and
0:18
actually this
0:19
is something that has evolved since i
0:21
was an undergrad when i started reading
0:22
about mental health and started
0:24
kind of collecting an excel spreadsheet
0:26
of all my favorite books that i used to
0:27
recommend to friends and to family and
0:30
people who are going through various
0:31
things
0:32
and i always had this vision that once i
0:34
had my private practice i would have
0:35
this giant
0:36
wall of all the books that i recommended
0:38
and i would loan them out to patients
0:39
because i think it can be a really
0:41
helpful part of treatment for patients
0:43
um and then
0:45
recently i kind of decided why don't i
0:47
just make a website with all of my
0:49
best book recommendations and so that's
0:51
where the
0:52
idea for the mental health library came
0:54
from and
0:55
um so you know and i feel like it can be
0:58
a good service to patients because
1:00
if you go to amazon and you google
1:02
depression books you get 30
1:04
000 results my goodness so many
1:07
and how are you supposed to know what's
1:08
a good book and the problem is that
1:10
there are things that you know there
1:12
are great books that are evidence-based
1:14
and they're helpful and
1:15
readable and they're great great books
1:17
and then there are some
1:19
that are just not consistent with the
1:20
most recent research and they're not
1:22
accurate information or they're not well
1:24
written and so they're just really not
1:25
going to be helpful for patients and so
1:27
when you go to look for those 30 000
1:29
books where do you even know
1:30
that you can where do you even know to
1:32
start and so
1:33
i feel like as a physician i can make
1:37
recommendations of the books that i
1:38
think are consistent with my knowledge
1:40
base and also readable and helpful for
1:42
patients and
1:43
books that i know have helped other
1:44
patients that i've had or people that i
1:46
know personally
1:47
and so that's been kind of the idea
1:49
behind the mental health library is to
1:51
collect all those books in one place so
1:53
that people can have a resource to find
1:55
good books

suggestive of kovat 19 before touching
0:26
the mask clean your hands with

alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
0:51
inspect the mask for tears or holes do
0:55
not use a math that has previously been

managing covet at home has two aspects
0:12
one is treatment and care of the person
0:14
with covid and the other is to take the
0:16
right safety measures to protect others
0:18
from getting kovid you should start
0:20
following these steps as soon as you
0:22
develop any symptoms or if you had a

have symptoms

0:34
dr r how should someone with kovid take
0:36
care at home the symptoms of covid and
0:39
their severity may be different from one
0:41
person to another
0:43
in most people covid can be managed at
0:45
home but you need to watch out for signs
0:47
of serious problems
0:49
the risk of severe illness and hospital
0:51
admission is 10 times higher in those
0:53
who are not vaccinated compared to those
0:56
who are fully vaccinated for treatment
0:58
and monitoring here are some things you
1:00
should do take good rest and keep
1:02
yourself well hydrated you can take hot
1:05
drinks such as water with honey soup or
1:07
tea for body aches and fever use one or
1:10
two tablets or tylenol or panadol as
1:13
needed usually severe body aches and
1:15
fever will start getting better after
1:17
two to three days if you have other
1:20
symptoms like cough stuffy nose or
1:22
throat irritation you can use cough
1:25
medicines or anti-allergy medicines as
1:27
well
1:28
monitor your temperature and your
1:30
breathing two times each day if you have
1:32
a pulse oxometer at home use it to
1:35
measure oxygen levels
1:37
using supplements like vitamin d and
1:39
vitamin c may be helpful in some people
1:42
but are not needed for everyone it is
1:44
important to know that antibiotics are
1:46
not helpful in covid or other viral
1:49
infections in some people with weak
1:51
immunity and high risk of covid getting
1:53
worse doctors may prescribe special

needed for those who have a severe

losing consciousness
2:30
dr r what safety precautions should
2:32
patients and family members take at home
2:35
proper home isolation is very important
2:37
to stop infection from spreading if you
2:40
have covid stay home for at least five
2:42
days even if you have mild symptoms or
2:45
no symptoms leave the house only for
2:47
necessary medical care
2:49
after five days if your fever is
2:51
resolved and your other symptoms are
2:53
almost gone then you may leave your
2:55
house as needed as long as you cover
2:57
your nose and mouth with a mask
2:59
keep using a mask for the next five days
3:02
and minimize close interactions with
3:04
others
3:05
after 10 total days you can interact
3:07
with others like before
3:09
if your symptoms and fever continue then
3:11
stay home for the whole 10 days as much
3:13
as possible
3:14
here are some tips for you and your
3:16
family for home isolation the person
3:18
with kovid should stay in a separate
3:20
room others should avoid coming in this
3:22
room if they need to come then they
3:24
should cover their nose and mouth the
3:26
mask or cloth
3:28
you don't have to wear a mask when
3:29
you're in the room by yourself each time
3:31
you leave this room then cover your nose
3:33
and mouth with the mask or cloth and
3:35
keep a distance of six feet from others
3:38
if you live in a single room home or
3:40
getting a separate room is not possible
3:42
then isolate yourself in one side and
3:45
keep a six foot distance from others
3:47
you can use a curtain or sheet to stay
3:49
separated open windows for good air
3:51
circulation
3:52
when others are in the room keep your
3:54
nose and mouth covered with a mask or a
3:56
cloth
3:57
if possible use a separate bathroom from
4:00
others if there is only one bathroom for
4:02
everyone then keep its window open for
4:04
air circulation and everyone should wash
4:07
their hands with soap and water after
4:09
using the bathroom
4:10
do not share cups utensils towels
4:14
pillows bed sheets and other items of
4:16
daily use with others
4:18
remember soap kills coronavirus so it is
4:21
okay to wash clothes and dishes together
4:24
after washing others can use them as
4:26
well
4:27
only one or two persons from the health
4:29
should take food and other supplies to
4:31
the patient
4:32
it's better for a young healthy person
4:34
to do this task and minimize the
4:36
interaction with elderly people and
4:37
those with medical conditions such as
4:39
diabetes
4:41
everyone at home should wash hands with
4:43
soap and water frequently especially
4:45
after visiting the sick or touching
4:47
their clothes and utensils after using
4:49
the bathroom before cooking and eating
4:52
and when coming home from outside you
4:54
should also use a hand sanitizer with at
4:57
least 60 alcohol for hand washing
5:00
dr r what should we do if we were
5:02
exposed to someone with covet
5:05
people living in the house and others
5:07
who were exposed to covid need to take
5:09
precautions as they might be infected
5:11
with the virus as well as it may take a
5:13
few days before they develop any
5:15
symptoms being exposed means that you
5:18
were within six feet distance without a
5:20
mask for about 15 minutes with someone
5:22
who was found to have covid
5:25
the risk of catching and spreading the
5:26
virus is much lower among those who are
5:29
fully vaccinated if you are fully
5:31
vaccinated and have received your due
5:33
booster dose then after having a covet
5:35
exposure you can still leave home and
5:37
continue other regular activities but
5:40
you must keep your nose and mouth
5:41
covered with a mask when around others
5:44
for 10 days after your exposure and
5:46
watch carefully for any symptoms
5:49
if possible get tested five days after
5:51
your exposure if you don't develop any
5:53
symptoms then return to normal routine
5:56
after 10 days
5:58
if you are not fully vaccinated or have
6:00
not received your due booster then after
6:03
having an exposure you should quarantine
6:05
in home for the first five days
6:07
get a test done on the day five if
6:10
possible if you don't have any symptoms
6:12
then you can leave home if needed after
6:14
five days but keep a mask on when around
6:17
others for a total 10 days after
6:19
exposure during those 10 days carefully
6:22
watch for any symptoms
6:24
if you get fever cough fatigue sore
6:27
throat loss of taste or smell difficulty
6:30
breathing or any other symptom then
6:32
isolate yourself at home and get tested
6:35
our fight against covet is everyone's
6:37
responsibility
6:39
we all need to play our part to keep
6:41
ourselves and others safe

in december 2019 the chinese authorities
0:02
notified the world that the virus was
0:04
spreading through
0:04
communities in wuhan china in the
0:07
following month
0:07
it quickly spread to other countries
0:09
becoming a global pandemic
0:12
this virus is a notorious severe acute
0:15
respiratory syndrome related coronavirus
0:17
ii or sargasso e2
0:19
that causes the disease called covet 19.
0:23
while the main focus of health agencies
0:24
around the world has been on the human
0:26
effects of the virus
0:27
pet owners have a slightly different
0:29
priority can pets get sars cov2
0:33
the short answer is no but if you're a
0:36
pet owner
0:36
you should still keep your guards up
0:38
during the ongoing pandemic
0:40
and we will tell you why in this week's
0:42
demystifying medicine
0:47
first let's look at what is a virus a
0:50
virus
0:50
is just a hall around genetic material
0:53
and a few proteins
0:54
there's really not that much to a virus
0:56
in fact it isn't even the living thing
0:58
because it cannot replicate itself the
1:01
only way for a virus to replicate
1:02
is by invading body cells once inside of
1:05
a cell
1:06
the virus hijacks the cell's machinery
1:08
and resources and makes millions of
1:09
copies of itself
1:11
crippling the body in the process
1:14
to enter the cell the virus needs to
1:16
pass through the cell's membrane
1:18
the virus does this by using cell
1:19
receptors which act as a shuttle that
1:21
sends the virus across the membrane
1:24
these shuttles however can only
1:25
transport specific substances
1:28
this is known as the lock and key model
1:30
as only substances that can fit into the
1:32
receptor
1:33
can be transported
1:34
[Music]
1:36
therefore viruses are only compatible
1:38
with specific receptors
1:39
as their surface proteins can only fit
1:41
into certain receptors
1:42
[Music]
1:45
the novel coronavirus relies on a
1:46
receptor called ace2
1:48
which is commonly found on the cells in
1:49
the lung this is why pneumonia is one of
1:52
the landmark complications
1:54
of copen19 if you take the ace2 away
1:57
the virus cannot enter the cell and
1:59
cannot replicate
2:02
ace2 is present in the cells of pets
2:04
such as dogs and cats
2:06
as well however the structure of human
2:08
and animal ace2
2:10
is slightly different this makes it more
2:12
difficult or even impossible
2:14
for the coronavirus to enter the animal
2:15
cells in other words it is like trying
2:18
to unlock different locks with the same
2:19
key
2:20
it probably won't work very well because
2:22
different locks correspond with
2:23
different keys
2:25
at this point some of you might say but
2:27
i've seen news of pets testing positive
2:29
for the virus on the news
2:31
most of these reports are simply false
2:33
positives the virus for example can
2:36
treat pets nasal cavities
2:37
where they can be picked up by the
2:38
sarsko v2 tests
2:40
however as previously mentioned it is
2:43
very difficult for these viruses to
2:44
actually infect
2:45
pet cells
2:49
some pets such as cats have h2 receptors
2:52
that are more similar to human compared
2:54
to dogs
2:54
and therefore they're more at risk of
2:56
sarco v2 infections
2:59
however even if a pet does get sick they
3:01
usually only get mild sickness
3:03
because their receptors are still
3:05
different from humans despite certain
3:06
similarities
3:07
[Music]
3:10
for this reason it is not necessary to
3:12
put a mask on your pet
3:14
but because pets can still carry the
3:15
virus without getting infected
3:17
it is still important to social distance
3:19
your pets from the others
3:20
and keep your outdoor pets indoors for
3:22

it's how skyla cellner started out the
0:05
year a positive test and typical
0:07
symptoms sore throat running nose stuffy
0:10
nose congested
0:12
coughing the cough was probably the
0:14
worst part lots of blankets skyla is
0:17
isolating at home managing best as she
0:20
knows how so i have on this table my
0:23
buckley's which helps tremendously
0:26
tea for my sore throat and of course
0:28
lots of water to keep me hydrated and to
0:30
get rid of that virus she still feels
0:33
miserable and wants to know what else
0:34
she can do would cold medications over
0:37
the counter drugs help with the symptoms
0:39
at all something like this for example
0:41
in intranasal cortisone can be very
0:43
useful for decreasing nasal congestion
0:45
this pharmacist recommends common cold
0:47
and flu medication including ibuprofen
0:50
and acetaminophen which he says can be
0:52
alternated every four hours to bring
0:54
down fever some doctors prescribe
0:56
puffers for people with a history of
0:58
breathing problems none of these
1:00
medications actually resolve the covet
1:02
infection but they have strong evidence
1:05
for relieving symptoms
1:07
once symptoms clear he says wait 30 days
1:10
for a booster there's no rush because
1:12
your antibodies should be pretty high
1:14
and they should provide you with
1:16
ample protection

hospitals are worried about being
1:20
overwhelmed by mild covet patients who
1:22
may infect others for the vast majority

of people you can manage this at home
1:27
it's unpleasant and it's uncomfortable
1:29
and certainly we appreciate that but she

stresses if your breathing gets bad
1:33
don't hesitate to seek care really the
1:36
thing that should drive you to the
1:37
emergency department with your coven
1:39
positive diagnosis is severe chest pain
1:41
and severe shortness of breath to

usually found in animals
0:12

while the less serious coronaviruses can
0:36
cause the common cold
0:37
these more serious viruses cause
0:39
symptoms that are so severe that people
0:41
can't breathe and need to be
0:42
hospitalized
0:46
for most people covet 19 can be treated

symptoms like fever and congestion
0:56

0:59
for the people who develop much more
1:01
serious symptoms and need to be
1:03
hospitalized
1:04
treatment is primarily focused on
1:05
supporting individuals while their body
1:07
fights the infection
1:08
and to reduce the patient's symptoms
1:11
patients who have trouble breathing may
1:13
be given supplemental oxygen
1:15
if the oxygen alone is insufficient to
1:17
help the patient breathe
1:18
healthcare providers may choose to put
1:20
patients on mechanical ventilation such
1:22
as bipap
1:23
and in some situations they may need to
1:25
intubate and oxygenate the patient
1:27
through conventional ventilators
1:32
there are evolving guidelines from the
1:34
national institute of health on how to
1:36
treat covid19
1:38
an individual's treatment heavily
1:40
depends on their health condition and
1:41
the resources available to the health
1:43
care team
1:48
rem desevere is an antiviral medication
1:50
which disrupts a virus's ability to
1:52
replicate and spread within the body
1:55
rem desevere specifically is recommended
1:57
for patients who have been hospitalized
1:59
and require
2:00
oxygen but are not on mechanical
2:02
ventilation
2:04
globally rem desevere is in short supply
2:06
and many health institutions
2:08
have very limited quantities of it
2:12
dexamethasone is a corticosteroid a drug
2:15
that makes adjustments to how the immune
2:17
system regulates itself
2:19
dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids
2:21
similar to it
2:22
can be used in patients who need oxygen
2:24
and can be used on patients who are on
2:26
mechanical ventilation or not on
2:28
mechanical ventilation
2:30
however patients who do not need oxygen
2:32
are not recommended to take
2:33
dexamethasone as the side effects of the
2:35
drug may worsen their condition
2:40
there have been a number of proposed
2:42
treatment solutions you might have heard
2:44
about in the news too
2:45
such as the use of injecting the blood
2:47
plasma of people who've recovered from
2:48
covet 19
2:50
also called convalescent plasma into
2:52
patients who are seriously ill with the
2:54
disease
2:55
in september 2020 the national institute
2:58
of health issued a statement that even
2:59
with initial trials there hasn't been
3:01
enough evidence to show this treatment
3:03
plan helps or harms patients
3:05
and they do not recommend using this
3:06
treatment as part of routine treatment
3:08
plans for the time being
3:12
in the spring of 2020 there was a lot of
3:15
news coverage regarding the use of
3:16
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to
3:18
treat severe covid19 patients
3:21
in august of 2020 the national institute
3:24
of health issued a statement that
3:25
recommended against using these drugs as
3:27
initial trials in covid19 patients had
3:30
either shown no benefit at all
3:32
or had led to worse outcomes for
3:33
patients due to the drug's inherently
3:35
dangerous side effects
3:40
as a quick recap covet 19 is a virus
3:43
that produces symptoms similar to the
3:44
common cold however in some individuals
3:47
symptoms can be so severe they are life
3:49
threatening
3:50
for mild and moderate symptoms patients
3:52
can be treated with rest and
3:53
over-the-counter medications
3:56
for severe symptoms patients may need

4:00
ventilation guidelines for treatments
4:02
are constantly evolving and some

can we reuse a disposable mask
0:03
the answer will surprise you this video
0:06
presented with available information
0:08
from various health magazines and public
0:10
authority websites
0:11
can we wash disposable surgical masks
0:14
you know those single-use masks to
0:16
prevent the spread of covid
0:18
can they ultimately be used several
0:20
times without risk
0:21
because we all thought at the start that
0:23
we should throw them away after each use
0:26
result tons of waste in the bins
0:28
fortunately the health organizations did
0:31
some tests to see what really happened
0:33
to these masks
0:34
to answer this the experts carried out
0:37
tests on three models of surgical masks
0:39
purchased in supermarkets and drug
0:41
stores
0:42
wondering if you can reuse your
0:43
disposable surgical mask
0:45
the answer will surely surprise you
0:48
masks still as effective
0:50
the answer is clear surgical masks
0:52
retain good filtration capacities
0:54
even after being washed 10 times in
0:57
addition
0:58
wearing these masks remains comfortable
1:01
the breathing of the users has not
1:02
affected
1:03
they estimates that the masks can be
1:05
worn for several hours without it being
1:07
uncomfortable
1:08
they compared the effectiveness of
1:10
surgical masks washed several times with
1:12
that of cloth masks washed several times
1:15
as well
1:16
the conclusion for them surgical masks
1:19
remain more effective at filtering the
1:21
air they breathe in fabric masks
1:23
thus even after several washes the
1:26
protection of surgical masks remains
1:28
superior to that of fabric masks
1:31
according to these tests you can wash
1:33
and reuse your disposable masks 10 times
1:36
what tests have been done the experts
1:39
have carried out 10 machine washes at 60
1:42
degrees celsius
1:43
they were then tumble dried then they
1:45
were ironed at a very low temperature
1:48
the lowest setting of the iron what is
1:50
the conclusion
1:52
the filtration of the masks once washed
1:54
remains largely sufficient for general
1:56
public use
1:57
the filtering capacity is one hundred
2:00
percent for one of the surgical masks
2:02
ninety percent for the other the third
2:04
so-called comfort mask
2:06
obtains 98 filtration capacity
2:09
the rubber bands are still in place and
2:12
they are not damaged
2:13
the only problem is that the texture of
2:15
the masks is slightly different
2:17
it is more felted than if the mask were
2:19
new
2:20
masks made of washed surgical fabrics
2:23
therefore obtain
2:24
identical performance to fabric masks
2:26
bearing the dga guarantee
2:28
so depending on what to choose reusing
2:31
surgical masks as possible
2:33
and always by guaranteeing a good level
2:35
of protection
2:37
and that is rather good news for the
2:39
planet and our wallet
2:40
indeed surgical masks remain less
2:43
expensive per unit than a fabric mask
2:46
but that's not all they are also a real
2:48
ecological disaster since
2:50
they are made of plastic that cannot be
2:51
recycled
2:53
by reusing them we limit waste and save
2:55
money
2:56
but as soon as the mask is a little
2:58
damaged it must of course be thrown away
3:01
on the side of the directorate general
3:03
of health dgs
3:04
it is another story that we hear they
3:07
recalls that
3:08
according to the recommendations of the
3:10
high council of public health
3:12
disposable surgical masks should be
3:14
thrown in a trash after use
3:16
however remember that in the summer of
3:18
2021
3:19
the experts considered that it was very
3:21
complicated to disinfect a surgical mask
3:24
satisfactorily
3:25
according to this standard they must
3:27
ensure 95
3:29
filtration efficiency of bacteria both
3:32
of these masks were purchased from

supermarkets
3:35
the third mask was purchased at a

0:07
advisors I'm doctor Praveen cherry poly
0:09
I'm an internal medicine physician from
0:11
Florida United States in this video I'm
0:14
going to discuss with you how to
0:16
disinfect and reuse a face mask
0:20
[Music]
0:22
microwaving this is probably the easiest
0:25
way to disinfect a face mask regular
0:31
face mask like this are pretty safe for
0:34
microwaving you need to microwave for
0:36
about a minute however some of the n95
0:40
face masks that used these elastic bands
0:46
are not really safe these elastic bands
0:49
can get burned when you microwave then
0:52
90 a mask the metal no space is pretty
0:55
safe however some n95 masks which use a
0:59
regular string they are pretty safe
1:02
again so you can use the regular face
1:05
mask or n95 masks that use a regular
1:08
string to microwave and disinfect them
1:12
microwave steaming this is a new
1:17
technique described by the American
1:19
Society of microbiology in a recent
1:22
study in this technique you take a glass
1:25
container fill it with water secure a
1:28
mesh over the top of the glass container
1:31
with a rubber band place the mask on the
1:34
top of this mesh and microwave it for 3
1:38
minutes the steam generated by the
1:41
microwaving helps to disinfect the mask
1:44
in this study they use this technique 20
1:48
times on one mask and they found that
1:51
the mask was still intact
1:53
all the components of the mask were
1:55
intact so this is one of the effective
1:58
techniques to disinfect a face mask
2:06
washing cloth mask if you use a cloth
2:12
mask washing the cloth mask is probably
2:14
the best approach you don't have to wash
2:17
them separately you can wash a cloth
2:20
mask along with all other clothes with a
2:23
detergent ultraviolet lamps ultraviolet
2:30
lights are FDA approved they can kill
2:33
bacteria and viruses by 99.99% they can
2:38
also kill corona virus you can use
2:41
ultraviolet lights to disinfect your
2:43
face mask there are so many different
2:45
varieties of ultraviolet devices
2:47
available in the market another way to
2:55
reuse a face mask is to simply hang your
2:58
face mask to a hook or a nail whenever
3:02
you're back home simply hang the face
3:04
mask and leave it aside for at least 72
3:07
hours
3:08
coronavirus usually survives on face
3:10
masks up to 72 hours if you leave it
3:13
aside for 72 hours we can start reusing
3:16
the face mask as long as it is not
3:18
visibly dirty similarly you can also
3:21
store the face mask in a breathable
3:24
paper bag or a Tupperware box or a
3:29
styrofoam box you can store your face
3:32
mask for 72 hours and you can reuse the
3:35
face mask 72 hours later
3:39
[Music]
3:46
with this approach you don't really
3:49
disinfect a facemask however you can
3:52
definitely reuse it so these are all the
3:55
different techniques that you can use to
3:57
disinfect and reuse your face mask I

When to End Your COVID-19 Self-Quarantine
0:03
- So when do you come out of the self-quarantine?
0:06
So there's actually three situations.
0:09
First thing is when you're sick with COVID.
0:12
When you stop having symptoms,
0:14
meaning you stop having a cough,
0:16
you stop having trouble breathing
0:18
and when you stop having fever
0:20
for at least three days without taking Tylenol
0:23
is when you can come out of your self-quarantine
0:26
and mingle with others.
0:28
Typically this is at least about 10 days
0:30
from the first day of onset of symptoms.
0:34
So this is for people who are sick
0:36
and symptomatic with COVID-19.
0:38
The second situation is, what do you do
0:40
when you're asymptomatic and you get tested positive?
0:43
When you're asymptomatic, you don't know
0:45
if you're going to develop symptoms or when you would.
0:48
In that case, you self-isolate yourself
0:52
for 10 days from the date of the positive test.
0:56
If you remain asymptomatic, the 10th day
0:59
you come out of your self-isolation or quarantine.
1:02
The third situation is what if you come in contact
1:05
with somebody with COVID-19?
1:07
You know they have tested positive and you were with them
1:10
the previous 48 hours you were in contact with them.
1:13
In that case, same thing.
1:14
You don't know when you're gonna develop symptoms
1:16
or if you're gonna develop symptoms.
1:19
You have to self-isolate or quarantine yourself for 14 days.
1:24
